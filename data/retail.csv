Walmart breaks record with Q2 online grocery share,https://chainstoreage.com/walmart-breaks-record-q2-online-grocery-share,"facebooktwitterlinkedInemail
Walmart Inc. is more dominant in the U.S. online grocery market than ever.
According to the ""U.S. eGrocery Market Share Report Q2 2024,"" based on data from the monthly Brick Meets Click/Mercatus grocery shopping survey, Walmart (excluding Sam’s Club) captured 37% of the U.S. online grocery market in the second quarter of 2024, climbing 1.5 percentage points from the same quarter in 2023 to mark its highest share level to date.
In contrast, supermarkets lost 2.5 percentage points during the recent quarter compared to a year ago to finish the second quarter of 2024 with 27.3%. Walmart’s sales share (excluding Sam’s Club) began gaining on supermarkets in early 2022 after the expiration of the expanded child tax credit at the end of 2021 and as overall and food at home inflation was growing faster than wages.
According to Brick Meets Click/Mercatus analysis, this led to dramatic drops in the personal savings rate and rapid growth of outstanding credit card balances while interest rates continued rising.

Meanwhile, Brick Meets Click/Mercatus data indicates Target has made more moderate sales share gains over the last several years, gaining 1.2 percentage points of share from the second quarter of 2021 and finishing the second quarter of 2024 with 7% of online grocery sales.
Brick Meets Click/Mercatus analysis suggests that strong execution in filling pickup orders and a price gap halfway between supermarkets and Walmart likely helped Target’s online grocery performance.
Analysis of mass/supermarket Q2 performance
Overall, the study shows that the mass format captured nearly half of all delivery sales in the second quarter of 2024, driven by Walmart’s nearly eight-percentage point jump in delivery share from the same quarter in 2023.
During the same period, supermarkets went from leading mass in delivery sales share by about one point to trailing by nearly 10 points, although recent promotional pushes by Instacart helped to boost supermarket sales share between the first and second quarters of 2024.
During the same period, supermarkets went from leading mass in delivery sales share by about one point to trailing by nearly 10 points, although recent promotional pushes by Instacart helped to boost supermarket sales share between the first and second quarters of 2024.
In pickup, supermarkets ended the quarter with approximately 28% of the segment’s sales compared to mass, which claimed almost 58%. Mass lost one percentage point of pickup sales share year-over-year, while supermarkets lost more than double (2.1 percentage points). Pickup continues to remain the dominant receiving method for online grocery sales in the U.S. with a 45.5% share, down 1.1 percentage points year-over-year.
The share of supermarket customers who also shopped with mass during the quarter rose 3.7 percentage points, reaching more than 32% with roughly one in five doing so with Walmart. This gain was fueled by increased dual usage within the middle two income groups ($50,000 to $99,000 annual household income and $100,000 - $199,000) while both the lowest ( less than $50,000) and highest-income ($200,000-plus) groups decreased cross-shopping year-over-year.
""Walmart’s reputation for low prices helped to attract households that wanted both the convenience of shopping online and ways to save money in this market,"" said David Bishop, partner at Brick Meets Click. ""The execution of its omnichannel strategy, plus the operational efficiencies aided by incredibly high order demand, has enabled Walmart to consistently deliver the type of experiences that customers expect and to lower its cost to serve online orders at the same time.""
The analysis leverages data from the monthly Brick Meets Click/Mercatus grocery shopping survey, an independent research initiative conducted by Brick Meets Click since March 2020, and sponsored by Mercatus.
Online grocery sales rise in June fueled by delivery and ship-to-home   June was a strong month for online grocery sales in the United States, with sales increasing 8% year-over-year.           Online grocery sales projected to reach almost $120 billion by 2028   A new forecast shows online grocery sales are on pace to grow three-times faster than in-store sales over the next five years.

Big Lots closing about 300 stores; California takes big hit,https://chainstoreage.com/big-lots-closing-about-300-stores-california-takes-big-hit,"facebooktwitterlinkedInemail
Big Lots is downsizing.
In a new filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Ohio-based discounter  revealed it may shutter up to 315 stores under amended credit and loan terms.  In a June SEC filing, Big Lots, which has about 1,390 stores nationwide, said it was planning to  close between 35 to 40 stores in 2024. In the same filing, the company also warned of its ability to survive as a ""going concern.”
Since the June filing, Big Lots has updated the store location section on its  website, which now shows nearly 300 stores earmarked for closure (as of Aug. 2). California ranks as the state with the most shutterings, with 75 of its 109 stores going dark. By contrast, no closings are cited in Texas, where the company operates 116 stores, the most of any state.
Under the revised financial terms in the new filing, Big Lots and its lenders agreed to reduce the retailer’s available credit to $800 million from $900 million. The interest rate on borrowing rose 50 basis points and Big Lots must also report more frequently to its lenders.
Big Lots has been working to shore up its liquidity during the past few months. Sales tumbled 10.2% to $1 billion in its first quarter, which ended May 4, with a 9.9% decrease in comparable sales. The retailer cited a continued pullback in consumer spending by its core customers.
“While we made substantial progress on improving our business operations in Q1, we missed our sales goals due largely to a continued pullback consumer spending by our core customers, particularly in high ticket discretionary items,"" CEO Bruce Thorn said in the earnings release.
In its June filing, Big Lots noted it had net losses and used cash in operating activities in 2022, 2023 as well as the first quarter of 2024. While it currently is in compliance with its credit agreements, the retailer said that it ""expects to experience further operating losses and expects to experience difficulty remaining in compliance with such covenants.""

Walmart is expanding its ""Walmart Realm"" immersive shopping environment for back-to-college season.

Walmart pursues influencer, virtual commerce
Walmart has been actively expanding the channels it uses to conduct commerce. In late 2022, it rolled out a program called Walmart Creator, designed to make it easy for social media influencers and content creators to monetize shoppable products from the retailer.
Creators who sign up have access to tens of thousands of products and can earn commissions on sales they refer. The discounter has also engaged in a number of livestream sales programs with influencers across several social media and live commerce platforms.
In the area of virtual commerce, Walmart recently stepped up its metaverse commerce efforts with a groundbreaking initiative on the popular Roblox immersive gaming platform.
The retailer, which debuted in the metaverse by launching two new metaverse experiences on Roblox in September 2022 and announced in September 2023 that it would deepen its commercial activity in ""virtual worlds,"" became the first entity to sell select physical items on Roblox.
Walmart’s IRL commerce shop in the experience enables Roblox users to check out the real world items chosen by its partner user generated content (UGC) creators, MD17, Junozy & Sarabxlla.
The company has also tested immersive commerce in a variety of online worlds, including the Supercampus gamified Roblox environment. And in January 2024, Walmart began providing developers in the Unity real-time 3D development environment the ability to integrate its commerce application programming interfaces (APIs) directly into their games and apps.
This will enable Unity creators to sell physical items in real-time 3D experiences across more than 20 metaverse platforms.

Walmart targets food waste with in-store 'depackaging' solution,https://chainstoreage.com/walmart-targets-food-waste-store-depackaging-solution,"facebooktwitterlinkedInemail
Walmart Inc. is rolling out technology to help store associates increase the sustainability of the retailer’s food waste stream.
The discount giant is implementing new technology from organics recycler Denali, as well as simplified processes, to aid associates in more efficiently ""depackaging"" food waste. Called Zero Depack, the new program removes expired food intended for the waste stream from its packaging.
At each Walmart and Sam’s Club store location equipped with Zero Depack, associates toss expired food items in a receptacle, and Denali technology separates the food from its packaging material with as much as 97% accuracy. This helps associates spend less time supporting the recycling process and more time focusing on customer-facing activities.
In addition, Walmart says making the separation of expired or unsalable food from its packaging easier creates cleaner waste streams and potential sustainability opportunities.
When food waste is picked up from participating Walmart or Sam’s Club stores by Denali, one possible outcome is the conversion of unsalable items into biosolids for multiple farming applications, such as compost or food for livestock. The precise output depends on the nature of the original material.

""Every Walmart facility has a part to play in operating more sustainably by making meaningful choices that increase efficiencies, reduce costs and improve the experiences for our associates and customers,"" R.J. Zanes, VP, facility services, Walmart U.S., said in a corporate blog post.
""For our customers, sustainability comes to life through the services and products we offer, while our associates experience it through our improved ways of working,"" Zanes said in the blog post. ""As an operator for almost 25 years, I've seen how integrating more sustainable practices across our operations can drive this and help infuse a sense of pride among our associates.""
Walmart fights waste
In 2017, Walmart introduced Project Gigaton, an initiative to avoid one gigaton (one billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide from its global value chain by 2030. Since that time, the discount giant has launched numerous efforts to promote sustainability across its enterprise and among its partners and customers.

Humana to open primary care centers for seniors at Walmart locations in four states,https://chainstoreage.com/humana-open-primary-care-centers-seniors-walmart-locations-four-states,"facebooktwitterlinkedInemail
Some of the spaces that formerly housed Walmart Health are getting a new tenant.
CenterWell, the health care services business of Humana Inc., said it plans to lease clinical space and open senior-focused primary care centers at 23 Walmart Supercenter stores in Florida, Georgia, Missouri and Texas. The centers will be located next to the Walmart stores in clinical office spaces that was formerly occupied by Walmart Health.
In April, Walmart said it had made the “difficult decision” to close its 51 Walmart Health clinics, saying the concept “is not a sustainable business model for us to continue.” Launched in 2019, the centers were designed to allow patients to manage their health care in one location, with services that include dental, primary care, behavioral health, x-ray, labs and more.
“We are looking forward to welcoming CenterWell into these purpose-built healthcare spaces to offer quality care to communities in four states,” said Brian Setzer, executive VP, Walmart Health & Wellness. “Leasing these spaces to a well-known and successful healthcare delivery organization is a win for customers and patients, as we continue to focus on our core health & wellness business of pharmacy and optical.”
The new senior centers will operate under the CenterWell Senior Primary Care and Conviva Care Centers brand names and will provide access to primary care services designed specifically for older adults. The facilities are expected to open no later than the first half of 2025.
‘We are excited by the unique opportunity to lease space from a world-class community partner such as Walmart and offer seniors in these four states greater access to our integrated approach to care,"" said Sanjay Shetty, M.D., president of CenterWell. ""These nearly two dozen primary care centers are specifically designed for seniors, and each location’s design, including dedicated entrances and easy parking, offers patients the access that they have come to expect at our clinics across the nation.”
The centers will open adjacent to Walmart in the following metropolitan areas:
•Tampa/St. Petersburg;
•Orlando;
•Jacksonville;
•Atlanta;
•Dallas/Fort Worth; and
•Kansas City.
Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
