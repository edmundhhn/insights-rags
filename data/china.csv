First Known Survivor of China’s Forced Organ Harvesting Speaks Out,https://thediplomat.com/2024/08/first-known-survivor-of-chinas-forced-organ-harvesting-speaks-out/,"In a chilling revelation that underscores the ongoing atrocities committed under the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Mr. Cheng Pei Ming, the first known survivor of China’s state-sanctioned forced organ harvesting campaign, spoke to journalist Tasnim Nazeer for The Diplomat about his survival against the odds.
Cheng publicly shared his harrowing experience at a press conference in Washington, D.C., on Friday, exposing his story and the ongoing forced organ harvesting that is taking place in China. His testimony offered a rare and disturbing glimpse into the horrors faced by prisoners of conscience in China, particularly practitioners of Falun Gong. Cheng is said to be the only known survivor of China’s forced organ harvesting, and his testimony is unprecedented in exposing the hidden horrors of the brutal industry.
A Brutal Ordeal
Cheng, who hails from a rural village in Shandong Province, was repeatedly detained and tortured between 1999 and 2004 for practicing Falun Gong, a spiritual practice rooted in Buddhist traditions. The Chinese Communist Party, which views Falun Gong as a threat to its authoritarian rule, has branded Falun Gong a dangerous cult and has systematically persecuted its adherents for decades.
Speaking from inside a car in Washington, D.C., Cheng told me, “One day in 2002, I was told to pack up and was suddenly transferred to Harbin Prison and later to Daqing Prison. It was there that I was tortured even more severely.”
Cheng recalled the escalating brutality he faced in detention. In a particularly harrowing episode, he was tortured to the point of losing consciousness. “On November 17, 2004, I was tortured again until I passed out. When I woke up, I found myself tied to a hospital bed.”
Here, his account takes an even more disturbing turn. “I remember being tied to a bed in the hospital,” Cheng said. “The doctors and several of the ‘610 Office’ officials were there.” The 610 office is a notorious secretive and powerful organization within the CCP, tasked with implementing the crackdown on the Falun Gong.
“They said that I had to undergo an operation, but I firmly refused. They gave me an injection, and I quickly lost consciousness,” Cheng recounted. “When I woke up, I was still in the hospital and felt terrible pain in my side. There was a bloody tube connected to me. I was shackled to the bed.”
This was not an isolated incident. Cheng endured repeated procedures, all under the threat of death. “A few days later, they said I had to have another operation. I thought I was going to die “ he said.
During his imprisonment, Cheng was subjected to forced blood tests – an ominous indicator of his organs’ viability for transplantation. “They did blood tests on me many times and subjected me to all kinds of inhumane torture,” he noted.
“The torture in the prison was very systematic. One was mental and the other was physical [torture]. Mentally they put me and my family members under pressure as they wanted me to give up my faith in Falun Gong and if I didn’t they would force my wife to divorce me when I was in prison.” Cheng was told that if his wife did not divorce him she would face similar persecution as he was facing.
After hours of excruciating torture known as “the big stretch,” during which his limbs were painfully stretched from all corners, Cheng swallowed a small rusty nail and a blunt blade he had found in the torture room. Despite not showing immediate signs of ill health, he was forcibly taken to the hospital on November 16, 2004.
His family was informed that there was an 80 percent mortality rate associated with the operation, supposedly to remove the objects he had swallowed. When Cheng regained consciousness he found himself shackled again to a hospital bed, with an IV tube taped to his foot, a drainage tube in his left chest, oxygen tubes in his nose, and a 35 cm incision on the left side of his chest. Typically, the removal of such objects would be done via endoscopy, but Cheng had undergone open chest surgery.

Following the forced surgery, Cheng was returned to detention at Daqing Prison, where he experienced severe shortness of breath and fatigue. Despite enduring ongoing torture by prison guards for his refusal to renounce Falun Gong, Cheng remained resolute.
In March 2006, he began a hunger strike and was subsequently transferred to Daqing Longnan Hospital. Upon arrival, his sister was present and witnessed Cheng being shackled to a hospital bed. A prison guard informed his sister that Cheng had supposedly ingested a knife and that the surgery required to remove it had an 80 percent mortality rate. This was the second time the family had been given such information, but this time, neither Cheng nor his family were asked to consent to the operation.
Cheng maintains that he had not swallowed any object and had no medical condition necessitating surgery before being forcibly taken to the hospital. He believes that the authorities were planning to kill him.
That night, before the scheduled surgery, Cheng requested to be unshackled to use the restroom across the hall. Upon his return, the guard, having fallen asleep and forgotten to re-shackle him, inadvertently provided him with an opportunity to escape via the hospital’s internal fire stairs.
“I noticed the fire escape on my way to the restroom and I knew where it was so I could use this to try to escape out of the hospital… I ran downstairs and called a cab in front of the hospital and quickly went out of the area into Tianjin city,” he said.
Cheng escaped as a refugee to Thailand where he stayed in a United Nations refugee camp. After a dramatic escape from China and a lengthy nine-year period of evading the authorities, Cheng made it to the United States in 2020.
A Grim Discovery
Once in the U.S., he underwent a series of medical tests that confirmed his worst fears: segments of his liver and a portion of his lung had been surgically removed.
“At that time, I didn’t realize that it was organ harvesting. After undergoing medical tests, I found out that my organs had been harvested,” Cheng explained. “Part of my liver and lungs had been removed. I didn’t even know about it until I was examined in the U.S.”
Transplant specialists have confirmed through recent CT scans that Cheng is missing segments 2 and 3 of his left liver lobe, as well as half of the lower left lobe of his lung. These findings, along with a detailed report on his case, were presented to a panel in Washington D.C.

There have been consistent allegations that China is engaging in forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience – mostly members of Falun Gong, but also Uyghurs and Tibetans – for decades.
In 2021, U.N. human rights experts expressed concern over credible information about the practice. “Forced organ harvesting in China appears to be targeting specific ethnic, linguistic or religious minorities held in detention, often without being explained the reasons for arrest or given arrest warrants, at different locations,” they said. “We are deeply concerned by reports of discriminatory treatment of the prisoners or detainees based on their ethnicity and religion or belief.”
But hard evidence has been hard to come by. Analysts have had to rely on meticulous analysis of China’s organ donation statistics and medical records to investigate the issue.
Cheng’s testimony changes everything.
David Matas, an international human rights lawyer and co-founder of the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China (ETAC), commented on the significance of Cheng’s case:
This particular issue required intensive research, as there are no surviving victims, no bodies to autopsy, and no easily accessible crime scenes or documents… Till now, there has not been anybody who was able to get up and say they have been killed for their organs. The bodies are often cremated after organ harvesting, so there is nothing physically to look at.
Mr. Cheng can say he has been organ harvested as there are parts of his liver and lung that are missing, and it’s incontestable. It provides a visual element, a speaking victim that we’ve never seen before with that type of abuse.
Matas emphasized the unprecedented nature of Cheng’s survival, but also noted that “Mr. Cheng’s survival itself is chilling because it’s the first case I have seen where someone didn’t even know about it until he got to the U.S. and was examined.”
“This case reinforces that Falun Gong practitioners are demonized to the point where they are not treated fairly, and that mistreatment extends to organ harvesting.”
Matas, who has done extensive research into organ harvesting in China, also provided a statement at the press conference that underscored the severity of the situation and sought accountability from the government of China. Matas believes there are over an estimated 100,000 people killed through organ harvesting in China per year.
A Tireless Advocate’s Efforts
Professor Sen Nieh, who has spent decades rescuing prisoners of conscience like Cheng, played a pivotal role in bringing him to the United States. “It started in late 2015 when a friend brought pictures of Mr. Cheng with a long scar on his body and shared his story,” Nieh recalled. “This touched me deeply, and I decided to help him. I visited members of Congress, foreign affairs committees, and senators, many of whom were very touched and wrote letters of support.”
After years of effort and with the support of colleagues, Nieh succeeded in relocating Cheng to the U.S. in July 2020. “He was hiding from the CCP in Bangkok too, and ultimately the rescue took five years. It was a miracle to me; I almost gave up, but it worked out. Mr. Cheng probably was the last group of people who could come to the States before the COVID-19 lockdown.”
Nieh emphasized the importance of Cheng’s testimony, stating, “Nobody knows what we meant by a survivor of forced organ harvesting because 99.9 percent die after being organ harvested. This is the first case we have found of a survivor.”
He further explained the medical evidence: “We have shown all the results that confirm that the left lobe of Mr. Cheng’s liver had been cut, and a small part of his lung had been cut. This case will force the CCP to face the fact that this person is a survivor, and they can no longer deny it.”
A Life Scarred by Injustice
Cheng’s survival, though miraculous, has left him with deep physical and emotional scars. “I’ve lost years of my life, and the fear of being hunted by the CCP never truly goes away,” Cheng admitted, underlining the long-lasting impact of his experience.
“Sometimes, I wake up in the middle of the night, reliving those days in prison. The faces of the guards, the cold sterility of the hospital room, the feeling of utter helplessness – it’s all still so vivid in my mind,” he shared.
Yet, despite everything he has endured, Cheng remains determined to speak out, recalling a pact with other Falun Gong prisoners of conscience back in China. “When I was in China in the prison I had an agreement with other Falun Gong practitioners that whoever would come out alive would tell the world to stop the evil crimes by the CCP, but many of them were already getting killed.”
By providing evidence of forced organ harvesting, “I am not only speaking for myself I am also speaking up for all those who have been tortured to death [by the CCP] who would never have the opportunity to be able to speak again and tell the world what really happened,” Cheng declared.
A Call to Action
As Cheng bravely shares his story with the world, the international community faces a critical moment. The Falun Gong Protection Act, introduced to the U.S. Senate last week, aims to address the crimes of forced organ harvesting in China. The legislation is a vital step in holding the CCP accountable for these heinous acts.
For Nieh and Matas, Cheng’s survival is both a beacon of hope and a stark reminder of the ongoing persecution in China. “Organ harvesting is still happening in China, and it’s not only happening but increasing out of control,” Nieh warned. “Our leaders cannot turn their eyes away.”
Matas echoed this urgency, stating, “We need to understand that forced organ harvesting isn’t just a human rights violation – it’s a crime against humanity. It’s happening on a scale that is almost unimaginable, and it demands a response from the global community.”
Cheng too said he hopes the heinous crime of organ harvesting can be stopped by the international community after hearing his lived experience of it.
“I am one of the lucky ones – I survived. But there are countless others who did not. Their voices were silenced, but I will continue to speak for them. The world needs to know what is happening in China. This evil cannot be allowed to continue.”

China Hits Back at the US in Response to Doping Allegations Dogging Its Swimmers,https://thediplomat.com/2024/08/china-hits-back-at-the-us-in-response-to-doping-allegations-dogging-its-swimmers/,"China is trying to fight fire with fire in the face of persistent doping allegations that have dogged its swimmers at the Paris Olympics.
The China Anti-Doping Agency called Thursday for more intensive testing of U.S. track and field competitors, citing in a news release past doping scandals and questioning how the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency handled them.
Repeated blasts from the Chinese agency have been echoed by reports in the government-controlled state media complaining about double standards applied to Chinese competitors. The reports have highlighted the more than 600 tests undergone by Chinese swimmers at the Paris Games with no violations found.
The World Anti-Doping Agency and World Aquatics have acknowledged that 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for a banned substance ahead of the Tokyo Olympics. The results were not made public until revealed by media reports earlier this year, with both bodies accepting the Chinese explanation that the positive tests were caused by tainted food.
After the details emerged, the United States launched an investigation under a law passed in 2020 giving federal authorities power to investigate sports doping and cover-ups.
In a meeting in Paris this week, the head of the China’s Olympic delegation told his American counterpart that China hopes the United States will stop its “long-arm jurisdiction” and ensure that athletes from all countries can participate smoothly and safely in the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles and the 2034 Winter Games in Salt Lake City, according to an account in an official Chinese sports newspaper.
China’s anti-doping agency and its state media have zeroed in on an American sprinter, Erriyon Knighton, who was competing Thursday in the 200-meter finals. Knighton tested positive for a banned substance in March but the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said an arbitration panel determined it came from contaminated meat, allowing him to compete.
The Chinese agency issued a release Tuesday accusing the U.S. agency of double standards. It followed up Thursday with the release calling for more testing of U.S. track and field competitors.
Some competitors from other countries spoke out about the controversy as China won 12 medals in swimming in Paris, including a gold in the men’s 4×100 medley relay that ended a decadeslong U.S. dominance of that event. Chinese swimmers have denied cheating.
U.S. swimming legend Michael Phelps doubled down on his support for tougher sanctions, including a lifetime ban for anyone who tests positive for a banned substance.
British swimmer Adam Peaty, whose team missed out on a medal by finishing fourth in the relay, blasted a system that allowed the Chinese swimmers who tested positive to compete.
“As an honorable person, I mean, you should be out of the sport,” he said, “but we know sport isn’t that simple.”

SEATO’s 70th Anniversary: Lessons for Asia’s Emerging Multilateral Alliances,https://thediplomat.com/2024/08/seatos-70th-anniversary-lessons-for-asias-emerging-multilateral-alliances/,"September 2024 marks the 70th anniversary of the much forgotten and often maligned Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). However, its legacy in fact provides invaluable insights for Asia’s emerging multilateral alliances, such as the “Quad,” “Quad Plus,” and the much-hyped but still hypothetical idea of an “Asian NATO.” Despite criticisms of its impotency and disunity, understanding how SEATO emerged and the internal divisions that led to its demise is crucial for navigating today’s complex geopolitical terrain.
SEATO, also known as the “Manila Pact,” was an international organization for collective defense in Southeast Asia, aimed at combating communist expansion in the region. Established on September 8, 1954, it emerged during a strategic interregnum when postcolonial independence struggles intersected with the United States’ ascent as a superpower and emerging priorities to contain the global expansion of communism.
Back in 1949, Washington had just formed NATO to counter the Soviet threat in Europe and contemplated withdrawing from Asia as communists took over China. Fears of a resurgent Japan and the Chinese communist threat initially led countries like the Philippines, South Korea, and the Republic of China to propose an Asian equivalent of NATO, the “Pacific Pact” (the precursor of SEATO), while Australia and New Zealand sought regional security arrangements against Japan and the Soviet Union.
The Americans, wary of regional suspicions of imperialism, preferred a “consultative council” under an “Association of Free Nations of Asia and Pacific” to address concerns about Japan and promote anti-communism. However, disagreements arose over the inclusion of Japan, the United Kingdom, and France at an inopportune time when the Korean War escalated in the 1950s. The urgent need to resolve the Japan issue led the United States and its prospective allies to minimally agree on separate mutual defense treaties – what former U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, the architect of SEATO, described as a “spokes on a wheel” approach, now commonly known as the “hub and spoke” system.
None of the parties viewed this system as adequate or final but rather as a prelude to “a more comprehensive system of regional security in the Pacific area.”
In March 1953, ideas for a multilateral alliance emerged once more after Dulles urged Asian partners to undertake “United Action” in Indochina to counter the looming threat of a “Red Asia.” Dulles envisioned a coalition comprising the U.S., U.K., France, Australia, Thailand, the Philippines, and the Associated States (Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam), committed to defending Southeast Asia against communist aggression. However, internal disputes quickly arose as prospective allies jostled for their own interests and membership status. It became clear no one would accept this proposal unless the United States committed forces to Indochina and undertook long-term commitments to Thailand and Malaya.
Growing concerns over French military setbacks at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu soon prompted Washington to take concrete actions toward Dulles’ proposal, leading to backroom meetings to negotiate the formation of SEATO during the Geneva Conference of 1954. During these formative months before its inauguration, significant divisions emerged, particularly among the U.S., U.K., and France. The Americans were frustrated by the French and British reluctance to “hold the balance of Indochina,” reportedly “blocking everything” they wanted to do. The British appeared to be dragging their feet by attempting in vain to expand SEATO to include the Colombo powers (Burma, Indonesia, Ceylon, India, and Pakistan): all except Pakistan were rejected due to suspicions of imperialism. The British also opposed French imperial ambitions to include Cambodia and Laos. Except for the U.S. and Thailand, everyone else avoided specifying “communist aggression” as a threat since it would appear unduly provocative to Beijing.
By August 20, 1954, U.S. concern over its declining prestige in Asia, driven by a perceived failure to lead the fight against communism, compelled it to establish at least some form of security arrangement. Dulles insisted that he “c[ould]n’t come back without a treaty.” The resulting product was a compromised treaty that reflected the divergent interests of member-states. The reluctance to come to a consensus on the nature of communist threat led to a diluted and unrealistic goal of meeting the common danger of communist “aggression by means of armed attack” – an aggression that never materialized. Ultimately, Washington’s reluctance to commit ground forces in Indochina reduced SEATO to a symbol of anti-communist unity, serving more to preserve U.S. prestige than to facilitate effective military intervention.
SEATO’s institutional structure created impediments that hindered collective action over the subsequent decades. When the civil war in Laos and Vietnam escalated in the 1960s, the internal divisions became apparent. SEATO members, prioritizing unity over action, avoided measures that could threaten the alliance. As former Thai Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman put it, they aimed to “save SEATO from impotency.”
In 1973, Pakistan withdrew from SEATO in the wake of East Pakistan’s breaking away in 1971 to become Bangladesh. In 1977, the organization formally disbanded.
SEATO’s history is a cautionary tale for today’s multilateral alliances like the Quad. Both emerged from divisive geopolitical landscapes marked by significant doubts about their desirability – whose interests they serve – and their practicality – whether they would fulfill their intended purpose as a warfighting alliance given the subversive nature of modern great-power conflicts.
Today, the Quad does not suffer from the same suspicions of Western imperialism that bedeviled much of SEATO’s existence. However, fears of entrapment in a great-power conflict have sparked renewed debates about nonalignment, a relic of the Cold War. The fact remains that most Asian countries do not share the same regional threat perception regarding China that the United States does and do not want the Quad to develop into a countervailing alliance.
Should China pursue territorial expansion beyond Taiwan, such multilateral alliance proposals might emerge as cohesive and credible. But this scenario appears distant. China’s current challenges to the Indo-Pacific order are of a fundamentally different nature, requiring a hybrid approach to risk mitigation. If even at the height of the Cold War SEATO never faced a armed Chinese communist attack, contemporary policymakers must reconsider whether such alliances are genuinely useful or merely a means to mask insecurities about declining U.S. capacity to maintain regional order.
SEATO’s past also teaches us about the kind of problems that may emerge with a multilateral alliance in Asia. Allies often expect more than what is provided for in the casus foederis, testing each other’s commitment even on less critical matters to assess their reliability in more challenging times. During the Cold War, the inflated expectations of SEATO allies compelled the alliance to provide security against threats it was never meant to defend, such as communist subversion, the failure of which resulted in great disillusionment. Some decried SEATO as a “paper tiger,” appearing powerful against communist China but actually ineffectual, while others called it “deterrent diplomacy,” concealing the inadequacy of their defenses through diplomacy.
Yet SEATO was not to blame. The threat of communist subversion loomed large in its first decade, and SEATO needed to act or risk undermining broader regional confidence in the U.S. security architecture in Asia. SEATO’s experience is telling. Aspiring members of an Asian multilateral alliance must be prepared for the over-expectations of their members, especially in the face of China’s gray-zone operations, lest they be criticized for being just a talk shop.
SEATO’s history, with all its twists and turns, remains relevant even 70 years after its formation and nearly 50 years since its demise.

Nagasaki’s Atomic Bomb Commemoration Overshadowed by Israel-Palestine Divisions,https://thediplomat.com/2024/08/nagasakis-atomic-bomb-commemoration-overshadowed-by-israel-palestine-divisions/,"For the Japanese, August is a special month. The first atomic bombing on human beings occurred in Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and the second in Nagasaki on August 9. Then-Japanese Emperor Hirohito announced the surrender of Japan on the radio on August 15.
For Japan, then, August is a time to solemnly mourn the dead and to reaffirm the importance of peace.
However, this summer, a diplomatic spat is disturbing the serenity that normally marks this time of collective remembrance.
On August 9, the ambassadors of the United States and five other Western countries, as well as the European Union, skipped a peace memorial ceremony for atomic bomb victims in Nagasaki, protesting the city’s decision not to invite Israel to the ceremony. Notably, the six countries involved were Japan’s fellow Group of Seven members.
On the day, Nagasaki marked the 79th anniversary of the atomic bombing of the city. The two atomic bombings during World War II killed about 140,000 people in Hiroshima and 74,000 in Nagasaki, including victims who died from radiation exposure after the explosions.
For Nagasaki, its peace memorial ceremony on August 9 is the most important event of every year. the ceremony commemorates the victims of the atomic bomb and prays for lasting peace in the world.
Ambassadors from the U.S., the U.K., Canada, France, Germany, and Italy (all the G-7 nations except for Japan), as well as the Tokyo-based representative of the European Union, did not attend the ceremony. That was in response to Nagasaki Mayor Suzuki Shiro’s decision not to invite the ambassador of Israel.
“Given the critical humanitarian situation in Gaza and international opinion, there is a risk of unpredictable disruption occurring at the ceremony,” the mayor said at a press conference on June 3.
On August 8, one day before the peace ceremony, the mayor again denied any political motivation behind his decision and said that his only goal was holding the ceremony in a calm and solemn atmosphere.
Suzuki stressed the decision not to invite Israel’s ambassador was made after comprehensively considering the risk of unforeseen incidents such as demonstrations causing disruption.
The BBC reported that in June, “Suzuki said Nagasaki had sent a letter to the Israeli embassy calling for an ‘immediate ceasefire’ in Gaza.”
Nagasaki City usually invites all ambassadors in Japan to the peace ceremony every year. But it has not invited Russia and its ally, Belarus, since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
The ambassadors of the United States and the United Kingdom to Japan had called for an invitation to be extended to their Israeli counterpart, saying it was regrettable to put Israel in the same category as Russia and Belarus.
Instead of traveling to Nagasaki for the ceremony, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel attended the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Victims Memorial Service held at Zojoji Temple in Tokyo’s Shiba Park along with British Ambassador to Japan Julia Longbottom and Israeli Ambassador to Japan Gilad Cohen.
Asked about his absence from the memorial service held in Nagasaki, Emanuel told reporters that since Prime Minister Kishida Fumio was also in attendance, he believed the non-invitation to Israel was a political decision, not for safety reasons as claimed by the city of Nagasaki.
In the end, the Nagasaki Peace Ceremony was attended by a record 100 countries and regions, including Palestine. Even the countries whose ambassadors were absent – including the U.S., U.K., and the European Union – sent lower-ranking diplomats to attend.
By contrast, Hiroshima City invited Israel to the Peace Memorial Ceremony held in the city on August 6, and the Israeli ambassador participated, as did Emanuel. Hiroshima didn’t invite Palestine to its peace ceremony.
Thus division in the international community over the Israel-Palestine conflict was reflected in two ceremonies in Japan praying for peace.
Many Japanese commentators have argued that both Russia and Israel should have been invited to the ceremonies in both Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Advocates of this approach say that the ambassadors of countries that are violating international humanitarian law and taking the lives of many civilians, including children, should have to learn the importance of peace.
Israel’s massive retaliation to an October 7 attack launch by Hamas militants from Gaza, a Palestinian territory, divided international opinions and sparked further conflict and worldwide protests.
The Israeli invasion of Gaza, a Palestinian territory, following the October 7 attack has so far killed more than  39,000 people, according to Gaza health authorities.

Japan Issues First ‘Megaquake’ Warning,https://thediplomat.com/2024/08/japan-issues-first-megaquake-warning/,"Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio canceled plans to travel to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Mongolia following an unprecedented earthquake warning from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).
“I have decided to stay in the country for the next week or so to ensure our preparations and communications are in order,” Kishida said at a press conference on August 9.
On August 8, the JMA issued its first “megaquake” advisory, covering 29 prefectures along Japan’s Pacific coast. It is the first such warning under an alert system that was rolled out in 2019 as part of the Japanese government’s extended response to the 2011 triple disaster.
As Japan Today explained, “The current alert system came into effect in 2019, as the government sought to establish a way to put the public on alert for potential earthquakes despite the difficulty of predicting when one might strike. There are two alert levels – the lower advisory advises people to be prepared to evacuate, while the higher warning advises those in danger-prone areas to start evacuating.”
The current alert urges preparation, but did not call for evacuations.
The advisory stretches from Okinawa in the far southwest all the way up to Ibaraki prefecture, north of Tokyo, and came after a magnitude-7.1 earthquake in the Nankai Trough off Miyazaki Prefecture. There appears to be little widespread damage, but experts have urged caution and preparedness.
The JMA’s advisory, issued after an expert panel met, warned that “if a major earthquake were to occur in the future, strong shaking and large tsunamis would be generated.”
“The likelihood of a new major earthquake is higher than normal, but this is not an indication that a major earthquake will definitely occur during a specific period of time,” it continued.
Naoshi Hirata, professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo and chief of the JMA panel, said at a news conference, “We can’t tell exactly when or where a megaquake will occur, but we want people to reaffirm their preparedness.”
Experts noted that the Nankai Trough has a history of paired large earthquakes. The Nankai Trough is a roughly 900 kilometer-long trench on the ocean floor overlying the Nankai megathrust, where the Philippine Sea Plate is being subducted under Japan, which sits on the Eurasian plate.
The 1707 Hoei earthquake ruptured the entirety of the Nankai Trough and triggered Mount Fuji’s last eruption. At an estimated magnitude of 8.6, it was Japan’s largest recorded earthquake until 2011’s magnitude 9 Tohoku earthquake, which triggered a powerful tsunami that, in turn, caused the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The 2011 triple disaster resulted in more than 18,000 deaths.
Previously, the Japanese government has warned that the Nankai Trough’s next 809 magnitude quake had a roughly 70-80 percent probability of striking sometime in the next 30 years.
Located on the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” Japan is one of the world’s most earthquake-prone nations. The country sits at the confluence of four major tectonic plates and experiences around 1,500 earthquakes a year, most of them small and inconsequential. Nevertheless, as the 2011 experience made abundantly clear, the potential for a massive earthquake is very real and could have devastating consequences.

China Released New Renewable Energy Consumption Benchmarks,https://thediplomat.com/2024/08/china-released-new-renewable-energy-consumption-benchmarks/,"On August 2, 2024, China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and National Energy Administration (NEA) jointly released updated requirements for what percentage of energy provinces will need to source from renewable generators in 2024 and 2025. The requirements are a part of China’s renewable energy consumption guarantee mechanism and mandate a significant increase in the share of renewable energy in a number of provinces, as well as enumerating tentative renewable energy consumption targets for 2025.
China’s renewable energy consumption guarantee mechanism was introduced in 2021 as a way to increase domestic renewable energy consumption. The mechanism is very similar to a “Renewable Portfolio Standard,” a policy favored by Western governments including the United States and the EU.
The renewable energy consumption guarantee mechanism sets two targets: one for total renewable energy consumption and one for non-hydro renewable energy consumption. When it was introduced in 2021, the mechanism included a goal of ensuring that 40 percent of total national energy consumption by 2030 would come from renewable sources, including hydropower. This is crucial to China being able to peak emissions by the same year and reach carbon neutrality by 2060 – especially because even as renewable energy capacity continues to boom in China, consumption hasn’t always kept up.
In this context, these targets take on renewed importance because they are one of the most direct tools for mandating increases in renewable energy consumption.
The 2024 targets demonstrate that six provinces saw greater than 6 point increases in their renewable energy consumption mandate between 2023 and 2024. Heilongjiang saw the highest increase, with the required share of non-hydro renewables jumping from 22.7 percent of total energy consumption in 2023 to 30.0 percent in 2024. Hainan, Henan, Jilin, Hunan, and Gansu also saw increases greater than 6 percentage points.
Conversely, Sichuan, Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Yunnan, and Xinjiang saw the lowest increases in their targets. None of those six provinces are mandating increases greater than 1.5 points.
Based on this data, China is on track to meet its renewable energy consumption goals. For renewable energy including hydropower to account for 40 percent of total national energy consumption by 2030, the renewable and non-hydro renewable consumption share needs to grow at 1.3 points and 1.5 points per year. From that perspective, only three provinces (Zhejiang, Yunnan, and Xinjiang) fell short. The huge growth in the six provinces listed above more than makes up for those shortfalls, and means that the mechanism is serving its purpose.
The only potential cause for concern in the August 2 update came from the tentative mandates for 2025. In addition to articulating the binding targets for 2024, the policy update also announced tentative targets for 2025. This is done every year, and the targets are updated the subsequent year when they become mandatory. For the four provinces whose 2024 mandates were the highest – Jilin, Heilongjiang, Qinghai, and Ningxia are required to supply 30 percent of their power needs from non-hydro renewable sources – the tentative mandates for 2025 are unchanged.
Right now, it isn’t clear why. Those four provinces will definitely install more renewable energy capacity between now and 2025, and their renewable electricity consumption is almost guaranteed to increase in absolute terms. It might signal that the NDRC and NEA project increases in fossil fuel consumption in those four provinces over the next 18 months, which could mean that renewables will stay constant as a share of total energy consumption even if they grow in absolute terms.
More likely is that these are very conservative estimates that will be revised when they become binding, likely in August 2025. This was the case for the 2024 estimates. On August 4, 2023, when the 2023 edition of this update was released, the tentative mandate for Heilongjiang was that they would be required to source 24.4 percent of their energy from non-hydro renewable sources in 2024. The final number was significantly higher, and that pattern is consistent for all of the six provinces which saw increases greater than 6 percentage points.
Conservative estimates give policymakers more leeway to revise the mandates between now and when they actually become binding. Revising the targets up rather than down is likely to generate less angst, and for provinces whose grids already consume a significant share of renewable electricity, this gives policymakers more time and information so that the eventual targets more accurately reflect energy installations on the ground. From this perspective, increasing the 2025 targets is more a question of “when” and “by how much” rather than “if.”

Evaluating Colombia’s Strategic Partnership With China,https://thediplomat.com/2024/08/evaluating-colombias-strategic-partnership-with-china/,"Chinese President Xi Jinping once said that China “can only do well when the world is doing well… When China does well, the world will get even better.” His words highlight China’s view of its global significance and how its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) fits within the current world order. Over the past century, China has achieved rapid growth, especially since 1978, with the implementation of its reform and opening policies.
Colombia officially established diplomatic ties with China in 1980. Since then, China has grown into a crucial trading partner. The BRI, launched by Xi in 2013 in order to expand China’s global influence, has presented mixed success through its various public financing projects in the Global South. One of the best case studies of the BRI’s ups and downs is in Colombia, a traditional ally of the United States and a country with a history of conservative, anti-communist governments.
After electing its first left-wing president Gustavo Petro in 2022, that tide has shifted more rapidly, with China pursuing more aggressive projects and initiatives in the Andean country, and without controversy. Though Colombia has yet to join the BRI, the two countries enjoy a Strategic Partnership, signed in 2023, and China is now Colombia’s second-largest trade partner, and growing quite rapidly. “We view our future as a country that works with everyone, that collaborates with both the United States and China, we reject a Cold War framing of our diplomatic efforts,” a diplomat with the Petro administration said in Bogotá.
Colombia’s closer diplomatic ties with China are not necessarily new, however. Over the last few decades, many Colombian presidents have visited China, as did Petro in October of last year, and welcomed dignitaries from the People’s Republic. Colombia’s most conservative presidents of the last two decades, Álvaro Uribe and Iván Duque, also visited China.
Through these visits, Colombia and China have signed a variety of agreements and treaties, with China becoming an increasingly common source of financial support for energy, mining, infrastructure, telecommunication, and development initiatives. China has also opened a number of banking branches in the country and provided it with increasing legal and private tender reserves in yuan. Slowly, China has become a paramount economic and financial partner for Colombia.
During President Duque’s visit in 2019, the Colombian government launched the Colombia-China Initiative, a mechanism aimed at promoting the connectivity goals of the BRI without Colombia formally joining the initiative.
China’s efforts have mostly exploited basic gaps in the consumer markets and public necessities. Most of Colombia’s geography remains unconnected to any public road or telecommunication infrastructure; China has the capacity to reverse that trend. Given trade restrictions and difficulty accessing Colombian markets for foreign firms, telecommunications has been a source of financial strain for most Colombians in recent years. This has left room for Chinese state-affiliated companies like Huawei and ZTE to meet this need through various programs, including 5G service networks.
Water infrastructure, including running water and drinking water, has also been lacking in most of the country, particularly in coastal and remote areas, leaving China with an opening to provide financing for water access projects. Despite having two coasts on the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, Colombia also lacks the port infrastructure to become a larger commercial partner.
These needs are particularly acute in the Colombian Amazon, which remains very difficult to access and lacks basic government services and infrastructure. Finally, China has room to exploit the severe lack of structure and financing in the Colombian energy and mining industries. While Colombia is home to significant reserves of critical minerals and fossil fuels, lack of investment interest and lackluster government policies have made the sector difficult to navigate. Opportunities, however, have opened up for China to enter the field, in particular through the BRI’s multi-billion-dollar public investment program.
These needs have partially been met through Chinese investments. China is now the largest telecommunications and technological provider in the country, with around 35 percent of the market share according to September 2023 data. During Petro’s visit to China in October, new agreements on science and technology exchange were also signed, allowing for further market access for China.
POWERCHINA COLOMBIA S.A.S., a local subsidiary of POWERCHINA in Beijing, has been renovating two large water plants in Bogotá through these agreements, and China has contributed the primary financial stake in the Hidroituango dam, the largest hydroelectric dam in Colombia.
Chinese state corporations have also reportedly built water treatment plants in remote areas of the country. Beijing has also been looking to expand the Buenaventura port on Colombia’s Pacific coast, which would help bring in significant commerce and tourism, though the talks have not been transparent.
Furthermore, China has been financing massive infrastructure projects in Colombia, including the long-awaited Bogotá metro, extensions to the Medellín metro, the Trans-Amazonian Railway system, and the Mar 2 highway project in Antioquia and the Caribbean coast. China has been buying out struggling mining and energy projects throughout the country, most of which belonged to local and Western companies.
This includes the Continental Gold mine in Buriticá, which Zijin Mining bought for $900 million in 2019. China has also been acquiring a number of Canadian petroleum companies for billions of dollars, and starting fossil fuel projects with Colombia’s Ecopetrol. In addition to these critical sectors, China has been investing billions of dollars in agriculture, education, electricity, and other sectors to increase its influence and partnership with Colombia. The prospect of Colombia joining the BRI could make the pace of China’s investments rise significantly.
There are, still, significant problems and scandals surrounding China’s critical investments in Colombia. China’s human rights record, both at home and abroad, is appalling.
Through the influence acquired via the BRI, investigators have found that the Chinese government spies on Chinese nationals and uses its economic and political leverage to create harsher political climates and increase surveillance on Chinese nationals abroad. China’s state-backed Nickel hacking group is reported to work in Colombia, and the PRC also operates overseas policing stations and surveillance networks in neighboring Venezuela, Ecuador and Brazil. China’s governance preference for nationalist dictatorship also has significant ramifications for the future of democracy in Colombia.
There have also been accusations levied of untransparent business practices, overt mistreatment of non-Chinese workers, environmental damage, unethical negotiation tactics such as underbidding, and tensions with indigenous peoples.
These concerns can create tensions with the Colombian population, which has been reflected in polling, though most Colombians now say they welcome Chinese investment, even if they are wary of its culture and values. Moreover, the aggressive and secretive way in which China has conducted business has led to tensions with other business and strategic partners, including the United States. China has a lot of work to do to create a more open and receptive economic environment, and reassure critics of its intentions and objectives.
Colombia has traditionally relied on the United States for economic and strategic support. However, with the BRI driving growth in Asia and Africa, Colombia now confronts a difficult balancing act between its interests with the United States, and its growing partnership with China.
When the meeting between Petro and Xi in Beijing was announced, there was significant public enthusiasm for a potential agreement that would see concrete steps being made for Colombia to join the BRI. However, Petro asserted that Colombia should prioritize strengthening investment ties with countries that have a deeper understanding of its needs – a reference to China’s issues with integration, democracy, and human rights.
Moreover, as Colombia correspondent Santiago Torrado reported in El País in 2023, “Colombia is unprepared for the Chinese investment boom.” According to the focus and nature of President Petro’s meeting with his Chinese counterpart, the main topics on the table were purely diplomatic, specifically centered around the situation of the Bogotá metro. Therefore, it is understandable that for the Colombian government, relations with China and interests in the BRI are not considered short or medium-term priorities.
However, it is crucial for Colombia to recognize China not only as a global economic powerhouse but also as an example of resilience and success in overcoming significant challenges.
Like China did in its time, Colombia is facing uncertain prospects of outward growth and development, but through mutual understanding, educational cooperation, and joint efforts, the BRI could represent a concrete long-term goal for Colombia – one that promotes its economic recovery and future strength.

"Australia’s Ambassador to Mongolia on Cooperation in Mining, Civil Society, Defense, and More",https://thediplomat.com/2024/08/australias-ambassador-to-mongolia-on-cooperation-in-mining-civil-society-defense-and-more/,"In 2022, Mongolia and Australia celebrated the 50th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations. Despite the geographical distance, Ulaanbaatar and Canberra have successfully established strong bilateral cooperation in areas like education, mining, gender equality, civil society, and defense.
The Diplomat spoke to Katie Smith, ambassador of Australia to Mongolia, on the two countries’ ever-growing bilateral relations.
Considering the growing bilateral relations between Mongolia and Australia, what are some of the ongoing and upcoming major projects?
Over 52 years of unbroken diplomatic relations, Australia and Mongolia have an enduring partnership built on mutual respect and shared interests with strong economic, security, education, and people-to-people ties. Our two countries are located in an increasingly uncertain region, and we value Mongolia as an Indo-Pacific partner. I see our relationship as going from strength to strength. As Australian ambassador, it’s an honor to contribute to advancing our relationship to the next level.
Mongolia has great potential with its dynamic young population, commitment to democracy and natural resource endowments. That is why we’ve seen it as vital to invest in supporting Mongolia’s human capital.
Our education linkages are growing. Our Australia Awards scholarships to Mongolia have been running for over 30 years with 750 alumni. I was so pleased to be able to announce an increase of 50 percent to 15 awardees this year and hope to increase this number again next year.
These alumni, our “Mozzies,” are making remarkable contributions to Mongolia’s development in the Parliament, government, civil society, and private sector. They have inspired thousands more Mongolians to study in Australia, including around 9,000 this year. We are also planning to start a new program to support technical and vocational education and training in Mongolia to help build a competent workforce that will meet the emerging needs of the labor market.
Australia has a long-standing commitment to gender equality and the human rights of women and girls. In Mongolia, I’m very proud of our ground-breaking Women’s Leadership Program. The program assists our Australian alumni to improve their leadership skills, succeed professionally, and help participants deal with gender barriers in the workforce.
The Australian Volunteers program is another development program that strengthens people-to-people links between our two countries. Currently, we have 18 volunteers working with Mongolian organizations across a range of sectors. We’ve assigned volunteers to provide English language training to public school teachers, in support of the Mongolian government’s new policy to implement English as the second language in education.
Australia also has a small flexible grants program that supports social and economic issues important to achieving national and subnational development. Through this program, Australia has assisted more than a hundred Mongolian organizations to implement over 130 projects in priority areas of gender equality, disability inclusion, youth empowerment, and environment.
Australia and Mongolia will partner to tackle our common challenge of climate change. We’re planning to work with our partners to enhance women’s climate resilience as well as support our Australian Center for International Agricultural Research to start a project in sustainable grasslands management.
Our two countries also actively cooperate in areas of global and regional security and peacekeeping. Australian security experts and defense officials regularly participate in the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue and peacekeeping and humanitarian exercises such as Khaan Quest and Gobi Wolf.
An important part of our defense cooperation is long-term and short-term training programs for Mongolian defense personnel in Australia, and we’ve been running English language training programs for the Mongolian Armed Forces since 2018, which we’re increasing this year.
Mongolia’s dependency on its mining sector has been discussed for decades now. Australia is also a major mining economy. In your view, what are some of the important experiences Mongolia can adopt to diversify the country’s economy?
As Australia is a strong partner in the resources sector, it is encouraging to see Mongolia leverage its large endowment of natural resources to sustain strong growth in its mining sector. Minerals exports have and will continue to be a main driver of Mongolia’s economic growth for the foreseeable future. Mining plays a significant role – it provides direct and indirect employment, boosts education and skills development, and advances social progress.
As alluded to in your question, the economic fortunes of Mongolia are very much tied to the volatility of global mineral commodity prices and geopolitical challenges. Being blessed with natural resources is no guarantee for prosperity. Australia is no stranger to the challenges posed by an economic growth model underpinned by mining. Mining has long been part of Australia’s story. It is still important to our economy – it is called the backbone of Australia – it provides around 65 percent of our exports and around 15 percent of our GDP.
In my various engagements across government, civil society, and the Mongolian people, I have been heartened to hear that so many consider Australia as a developmental model with economic advantages similar to its own. Indeed, we share much in common such as our sparsely populated, resource-rich lands. Australia faces many of the same challenges that Mongolia is seeking to address now.
With a land vulnerable to climate change and lack of water, we’ve prioritized the highest social and environmental protections in our mining sector. We’ve developed strong safety standards. And we’re working on protecting our cultural heritage. We are aware that gender equality in our mining sector needs work. Our policies are continuously being improved to promote investor confidence.
As a proud third neighbor, Australia is pleased to be a strong partner of Mongolia in addressing these challenges. Through our Australia Mongolia Extractives Program (recently concluded), Australia was pleased to partner with the Mongolian government, private sector, and civil society to improve the investment climate and upscale the technical capabilities of both the government and the private sector to ensure extractives development leads to national as well as local development opportunities.
Moving forward, there is strong commercial interest and investment potential in Mongolia’s minerals and energy sector. Australian companies are well-placed to assist in developing a sustainable resources sector in Mongolia, which provides jobs and incomes. The Oyu Tolgoi copper mine is a world-class mine that we can all be proud of. Australian companies are bringing innovation, technology, skills development and the highest environment, social and safety standards.
Although mining and agriculture still account for a large share of Australia’s economy, our economic success also has been based on investment in human capital – a healthy, well-educated, and innovative workforce. Alongside this investment in the social sector were serious economic reforms, opening up the economy and privatization and liberalization.
The services sector, such as tourism, education, and finance, now constitutes the bulk of Australia’s economy, contributing to around 80 percent of production and nearly 90 percent of employment. Australia continues to invest heavily in education and research.
We continue to adapt to the changing global context; for example, the Australian government has a strategy to invest in critical minerals to seize the opportunities of the clean energy transition.
What are some of the challenges Australian businesses face in investing in Mongolia and how can the government address and improve the business environment?
I am pleased to say that Australia and Mongolia have flourishing economic and commercial ties. There are over 60 Australian-affiliated companies operating in Mongolia and Australia is keen to grow this presence.
Through our engagement with Australian businesses operating in Mongolia, I have heard much about the immense potential that Mongolia represents but also some of the key obstacles that companies face when developing projects.
We have been encouraged to see the Mongolian government take action to encourage foreign investment, in particular for mining investments, through the recent changes to the Law on Investment. A great positive that I hear frequently is the high capability of the Mongolian people – their innovation and ingenuity are strengths in business and developing ties.
Some of the notable concerns include bureaucracy and corruption, legal and taxation uncertainty, and infrastructure limitations. Navigating bureaucracy has represented a complex and time-consuming task for many Australian investors.
Addressing corruption remains crucial to attract foreign investment. We recognize that the government has been proactive in trying to deal with these issues. Concrete actions such as the shift to E-Government and increasing transparency, looking at the minerals law again, are going to encourage more investment here in the mining sector.
What are some of the social issues you have witnessed that you think Mongolia needs to focus on? Are there any Australian experiences Mongolia can adopt to solve these issues?
We’re proud to work in partnership with the Mongolian government and civil society to address some of Mongolia’s most pressing social issues. We have recently been cooperating on health, disability inclusiveness, environment, gender equality, human rights, and disaster management.
A crosscutting issue that we prioritize in all of our work is progressing gender equality. Mongolian women are strong, well-educated, and hardworking, and they make such a big contribution to the economy and society.
There are still challenges, including around women’s political participation and representation. The constitutional reforms in 2023 that increased the quota for women among party candidates to 30 percent and to 40 percent in the 2028 election are very much welcomed. We’ve also been pleased to work closely with the National Committee on Gender Equality and civil society organizations such as the Gender Equality Center.
Related to gender equality is addressing violence against women and girls. Australia has a National Action Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children within one generation. We recognize that it’s not only a social challenge, but an economic one. In Mongolia, we’re prioritizing ending violence against women through our advocacy and grants to partner organizations to prevent and respond to this issue at every level of society.
One of the most innovative ways we’re drawing attention to disability inclusion is through the support the Australian government has given to a partnership between Australian NGO Bus Stop Films and the Arts Council of Mongolia. They’ve collaboratively made two inclusively produced short films, “Stairs” and “The Dancer,” to highlight the challenges faced by individuals with a disability in Mongolia and how they overcome these.
Mongolia recently developed its long-term strategy, Vision 2050. What at some of the projects or development cooperation Australia is interested in and which sector Canberra is keen on cooperating in?
Australia is committed to working with Mongolia to support its social and economic development under Vision 2050. We’ve been focusing on supporting education, mining, and energy sector development and progressing connectivity with Australia.
I’m keen to deepen our cooperation and share Australia’s experience on climate change and agriculture. Mongolia and Australia are both grappling with the impact of climate change including drought, floods, fires, and extreme weather. We’ve seen Mongolia experience a particularly devastating dzud with an unfathomable impact on herders.
Australia is pleased to be partnering with the Mongolian Red Cross to provide humanitarian support to these families and to support the National Emergency Management Authority to deliver disaster resilience community education. To support longer term sustainable practices, we’ve supported a women in agriculture training course and are designing new climate resilience and grasslands management projects with our partners. Our reciprocal Work and Holiday Maker visa is enabling young Mongolians to gain valuable experience and skills in areas of labor shortage in Australia, especially agriculture.
In the area of governance and democracy, we’re working on strengthening human rights and supporting Mongolia’s vibrant civil society. We have an enduring partnership with the National Human Rights Commission of Mongolia. For example, we recently supported a fellowship with the Commission and seven organizations to visit Australia in partnership with Flinders University on Human Rights in the Digital Age.
Mongolia has much to share on its strong track record of protecting its democratic and human rights values. I believe this, coupled with an open market economy, economic reform, and tackling corruption, will enable Mongolia to thrive in the years ahead.
Given Mongolia’s energy dependency on its neighbors, the government of Mongolia has made efforts to diversify energy sources. What are some of the ways Australia is cooperating with Mongolia to improve the country’s energy sector?
As the world moves toward decarbonizing their economies and a clean energy transition, it is expected to drive an exponential growth in demand for resources. Without the critical minerals – without the iron ore, without the copper – to process all these materials, there is no net zero. And we want Mongolia to be part of this.
Australia is proud to play a strong role in developing the sector. Many Australian companies are already here, exploring and developing Mongolia’s mines but also contributing to Mongolia’s human capability – by bringing innovative technologies, developing skills, providing digital solutions and the latest technology to the sector. It is pleasing to see several Australian companies progressing in their exploration in coal bed methane and green hydrogen in partnership with Mongolian entities. There is great potential in Mongolia for these alternative energy sources for domestic use and for export.
Australia has made a commitment to reduce emissions by 43 percent by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. Alongside this, we have committed to achieving 82 percent of Australia’s energy production from renewables by 2030.
The Australian government is investing to upgrade, expand, and modernize Australia’s energy system to unlock greater penetration of renewable energy and accelerate the decarbonisation of the grid. It wants Australia to become a renewable energy superpower, with cheap renewable energy underpinning new, internationally competitive, and clean industries, including renewable hydrogen.
The Australian government has announced a Future Made in Australia agenda to maximize the opportunities of the net zero transformation. The government is investing AU$22.7 billion over the next decade to maximize the economic and industrial benefits of the move to net zero and secure Australia’s place in a changing global economic and strategic landscape. We are encouraging and facilitating private sector investment to make the most of this opportunity as we transition to net zero, while standing by our commitment to the rules that govern international trade and working closely with partners.
But a future made in Australia is, of course, not a future made alone. Australia is already a trusted energy supplier and has an abundance of sunshine, wind, and critical minerals – which, while positioning us to well to support our own decarbonization, also means we can help our neighbors with their net zero journeys. Future Made in Australia focuses on sectors where Australia can build a comparative advantage and make a significant contribution, such as renewable hydrogen, green metals, low-carbon liquid fuels, and critical minerals processing.
Australia wants to work with international partners – including Mongolia – to build the trade and investment partnerships needed to realize this ambitious agenda. Australia is keen to share its experiences and lessons learnt with Mongolia as we continue our net zero journeys, which will no doubt bring more opportunities for further cooperation and investment.

China Is Betting Big on Its ‘Little Giants’,https://thediplomat.com/2024/08/china-is-betting-big-on-its-little-giants/,"In 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) defined China’s “little giants” (小巨人) as companies with an annual revenue of 100-400 million yuan (roughly $14 million to $56 million), annual profit growth of at least 10 percent, R&D or innovation staff accounting for more than 15 percent of their total workforce, and at least five innovation patents related to products or 15 design patents.
China’s 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) clearly stated the goal to “promote the increase of professional advantages by SMEs and cultivate specialized and new ‘little giant’ enterprises and single- product champion (单项冠军) enterprises in the manufacturing industry.” The target of 10,000 little giants set by the 14th Five-Year Plan has already been attained; as per media reports at the end July 2024, China’s push to promote small and medium enterprises (SMEs) for technology advancement and new product development resulted in the creation of 140,000 SMEs with 12,000 of those being little giants.
China’s little giants are found in all the industrial categories in the U.N. Industrial Classification and are forming a key part of supply chains. 90 percent of these little giants cater to the requirements of big firms, locally and globally.
The strategy of supporting little giants is in sync with China’s Made in China 2025 campaign. Policy implementation is evident, with little giants receiving incentives both from the central and provincial governments. The central government created an exclusive package of 10 billion yuan for 1,000 little giants during the 14th Five-Year Plan.
Beijing’s reactions to supply chain shifts away from China – dubbed “de-risking” by the United States and European Union – can be gauged from the highlights of its state media reports. There is a repetitive insistence that China’s manufacturing remains insulated from the global headwinds and small shifts in labor intensive sectors, with the caveat that the firms still need to import intermediate parts from China. Often, these intermediate parts are made not by China’s global champions, by the its little giants.
Amid growing technology frictions with the United States and an increasing trade war with more trading partners such as the EU, China’s strategy of supporting little giants seems to be yielding results. As flagged by Xinhua in September 2023, select little giants are also contributing to reducing China’s need for imports in niche segments.
For example, Guangxi Crystal Union Photoelectric Material is involved with mass production of indium tin oxide (ITO), which is a key technology in smartphone display screens. Despite Guangxi being rich in indium tin, domestic manufacturers were importing the coating, which is way more expensive than the raw material. Based on U.N. COMTRADE data, China’s imports of ITO from the world fell by 22 percent in 2023, with the import value dropping from $53.5 million in 2022 to $41.5 million in 2023. China’s reduced imports of ITO from its four major import sources, including Japan (a drop of 48 percent), South Korea (a drop of 15 percent), Malaysia (a drop of 7 percent) and Brazil (a drop of 26 percent). Interestingly, China’s fifth largest import source of ITO in 2023 was Russia, which actually saw a sharp increase in import value – from a meager $2,000 in 2022 to $2.1 million worth of ITO sold to China.
This case speaks volumes about China’s diversification strategy. It illustrates both the success of China’s little giants in reducing overall import reliance on intermediate materials, while also showcasing China’s own “de-risking” to rely on friendlier partners like Russia.
Other successful examples of little giants working their way into China’s critical supply chains include PhaBuilder (which makes microbes used to produce industrial raw materials), Acoinfo (which specializes in industrial real operating systems), and Beijing Hanfei Aviation Technology (which produces single crystal turbine blades).
Besides building China’s domestic manufacturing capabilities to safeguard against growing external technology frictions, China’s little giants’ going global is an important trend to be watched out for. In June 2024, PhaBuilder collaborated with Solenis (headquartered in the United States) and Hengxin on green innovation. With such collaborations of China’s little giants across the globe, the complex global supply chains are expected to include the presence of these smaller firms for a long time to come. While foreign governments focus their attention on China’s state-owned behemoths, they shouldn’t overlook its “little giants.”

Commissioning 1000 New Ballistic Missiles Demonstrates North Korea’s Massive Production Capacity,https://thediplomat.com/2024/08/commissioning-1000-new-ballistic-missiles-demonstrates-north-koreas-massive-production-capacity/,"On August 4 the armed forces of North Korea – the Korean People’s Army – made an unprecedented display of ballistic missile firepower, with a ceremony marking the commissioning of 250 launchers for the KN-24 short range tactical missile system. Each launcher carries four missiles, for a total arsenal of 1,000.
The ceremony was attended by party, government and military officials, as well as defense scientists, technicians, munitions industry workers and “persons of merits in Pyongyang Municipality.” Commanding officers and other service members, presumably from associated missile units, were also confirmed to be in attendance.
The ceremony saw the missile systems handed over to Korean People’s Army “frontline units” near the Demilitarized Zone, where the bulk of the country’s ground forces have been deployed for decades.
By far the most outstanding aspect of the ceremony was the sheer number of ballistic missiles on display, which represented one of the largest displays in history not just in North Korea, but anywhere in the world. Just three months prior the release of footage showing 396 KN-24 missiles in a warehouse was considered unprecedented, and was widely interpreted as an indication of a new and tremendously greater industrial capacity. The commissioning in a single day of an arsenal over 250 percent as large provides a much stronger indication of this.
The KN-24 was first confirmed to have been test launched on August 10, 2019, with large-scale serial production thought to have begun several months afterwards at the earliest. That means the KN-24 has been in full production for under five years. Thus a current production rate of well over 200 missiles per year, and possibly closer to or exceeding 300 missiles, would be needed to equip all the launchers seen.
This is aside from the fact that each launcher for such systems is usually supported by a reloader vehicle to allow additional missiles from storage to be deployed, meaning for each missile seen on a launcher there are usually at least two or three missiles in service. Thus launchers accommodating 1,000 missiles would usually indicate an arsenal of at the very least 2,000-3,000, in this case signaling production capacity of well over 400 per year. However, it is also possible that the launchers were put into service before these additional stockpiles for reloading were available and annual production has remained at under 300 missiles – still a tremendous quantity.
It is also notable that the missiles displayed at the ceremony were far from representative of the sum total of all KN-24 production. The missiles are known to be deployed from other kinds of launch vehicles than the six wheelers seen at the ceremony – most notably from 12-wheeled tracked launchers designed to operate from difficult terrain.
This is aside from the fact that KN-24 missiles have been fired in considerable numbers both in tests and as shows of force. Additional missiles have also been exported to Russia and utilized in combat in Ukraine. The fact that North Korea can still commission 1,000 of the new missiles on a single launch vehicle type, and likely has produced many more KN-24s, thus represents a truly staggering industrial achievement – one far beyond the industrial constraints that the country was previously thought to have.
To place the production of 1,000 ballistic missiles from a single class in under five years in perspective, no other ballistic missile class in the world is thought to be in production in such numbers. The lone exception is the Russian 9K720 used by the Iskander-M system, albeit only because of a surge in production from 2022 to meet wartime needs. North Korea is producing in peacetime.
North Korean state media reports and statements by officials in attendance at the ceremony thus particularly emphasized the significance of manufacturing efforts required to produce the large number of ballistic missiles and associated launch vehicles for service. The state run Korean Central News Agency reported on the “heroic struggle of the munitions workers”:
The workers of major munitions enterprises, fully awakened to the sense of their important mission that the increased production of military hardware precisely means the safeguarding of the national dignity and sovereignty, have waged an intensive struggle to successfully attain the important munitions production goals set forth at the Eighth Party Congress and the enlarged meetings of the Central Military Commission of the WPK. Thus, they have performed the proud feats of serially producing in a short span of time main strike military hardware indispensable for implementing the Party’s military strategic idea.
At the ceremony, Workers’ Party of Korea Central Committee Secretary Jo Chun Ryong stated that “the new-type tactical ballistic missile weapon system newly developed and produced by munitions industrial workers is a powerful up-to-date tactical attack weapon.”
The commissioning ceremony for new KN-24 systems follows multiple prior indications that North Korea’s production capacity for ballistic missiles has indeed grown very significantly – albeit none of them were anywhere near the production scale of the KN-24. A mass display of 12 Hwasong-17 intercontinental range ballistic missiles on February 8, 2023 raised serious concerns among Western analysts regarding their ability to overwhelm American missile defenses – a worry that only worsened after flight testing of a multiple independent reentry vehicle for the missiles began in late June.
Footage in January 2023 showed 28 Hwasong-12s intermediate range “Guam Killer” missiles at the Thaesong Machine Factory, with this number of such large missiles considered very significant, particularly for such a small country. Where these displays were significant by North Korean standards, but still dwarfed by the arsenals of larger powers such as China and Russia, the KN-24 display is significant by global standards.
Despite benefiting from a highly educated and skilled workforce with negligible labor costs, and from state-owned supply chains that can manufacture very cheaply, the production of solid-fueled missiles with precision guidance is still far from cheap. This makes the commissioning in a short period well over 1,000 missiles from a single class particularly notable for what it implies about North Korea’s economy.
Despite being more sophisticated and thus costly to produce, the KN-24 is in production on a scale several times as high as the Scud-type and Tochka-type missiles that preceded it in the country’s arsenal, even though North Korean industry’s focus on such short-ranged ballistic missile types has decreased significantly over time as a much more diverse range of missiles entered service. The commissioning is one of a growing number of indicators that the size of North Korea’s economy and industrial base and their growth rates have been seriously underestimated. Such indicators in the civilian economy have ranged from the country’s construction boom, to the large increase seen in the variety of products on display at trade shows, and North Korea’s unexpected resilience when foreign trade ties were severed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The military implications of the commissioning and forward deployment of launchers accommodating 1,000 new KN-24 missiles are significant. These compact missiles’ use of solid fuel composites significantly shortens their launch times, making them particularly difficult to seek and destroy before firing their payloads.
The missiles are also well optimized to evade enemy air defenses by maneuvering along an irregular trajectory, much like the larger KN-23. The United States’ Congressional Research Service referred to the KN-24 as a system that “demonstrates the guidance system and in-flight maneuverability to achieve precision strikes.” Alongside the KN-23 and the KN-25 rocket artillery system, it was referred to as one of three systems that “appear to be directed at developing capabilities to defeat or degrade the effectiveness of missile defenses deployed in the region: Patriot, Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), and Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD).”
Observing signs of an expanded production scale of the KN-24 in January, an assessment published by the Army Recognition Group similarly noted regarding the system’s capabilities:
One of the key features of the KN-24 is its ability to maneuver in flight, allowing it to fly on non-parabolic trajectories. This capability makes the missile more challenging to intercept as it complicates the prediction of its flight path for missile defense systems. In addition, the missile has shown enhanced accuracy in its test firings, including the capability to strike a target as small as a 100-meter-wide island.
The fact that the KN-24 can also be used for delivery of non-conventional warheads, including the new Hwasan-31 tactical nuclear warhead, and possibly a range of chemical weapons that North Korea is speculated to field, makes them particularly potent.
North Korean forces forward deployed near the DMZ benefit from a particularly dense network of underground fortifications, allowing systems such as the road mobile KN-24 to deploy safely underground, emerging to fire on its target before again withdrawing. In January I detailed how the wartime importance of this capability has been demonstrated by the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, which has used a North Korean-built underground fortification network in Southern Lebanon during hostilities with Israel.
A further and more obvious benefit of forward deployment is that it allows the systems, which have limited estimated ranges of 410 km, to reach targets deep into South Korean territory. The systems have a key role in nullifying many of the U.S. and South Korea’s conventional advantages, in particular their air power through the ability to strike bases hosting aviation assets.
Beyond the Korean Peninsula, North Korea’s massive capacity for production of sophisticated tactical missiles serves to seriously shift the balance of power against the interests of its adversaries in the Western world across multiple theaters. This is currently particularly significant in Eastern Europe, where Russia’s arsenal of Iskander-M missiles, bolstered from late 2023 by KN-23s and KN-24s, has played an increasingly central role in hostilities against Ukraine and its Western allies.
North Korea has long fielded by far the world’s largest artillery force, with 412 percent as much towed and self propelled artillery as the Russian Army at a conservative estimate and 625 percent as much rocket artillery. The KN-24 display, however, provides one of several indications that it could soon boast at least parity with, if not a significant advantage over, Russian industry in terms of its productive capacity for tactical missiles as well as the size of its arsenal.
With such a standing, the implications of North Korean missile exports to Russia are significantly greater. The potential implications for other theaters, most notably the Middle East, are also highly significant, with escalated tensions expected to raise a number of parties’ interest in acquisitions – many of which, such as Syria, Egypt, and Hezbollah, are long-standing clients for North Korean tactical missiles or other equipment.

Guangzhou Shows Why China Is So Attractive to the Global South,https://thediplomat.com/2024/08/guangzhou-shows-why-china-is-so-attractive-to-the-global-south/,"According to United Nations projections, by 2100, eight out of 10 people will live in Asia or Africa. This demographic shift starkly contrasts with the trends in Europe and North America, where many countries are struggling with demographic decline. While numbers alone do not define the future, such a significant disparity between the populations of emerging economies and those of developed ones will inevitably reshape the global economic and political order. This means globalization too will be very different from the one we know.
These global changes are already tangible, and cities provide an ideal spot to observe them. New York has been the quintessential city of the current era of globalization, which has been shaped and dominated by the West. It is a city of opportunity that, in the 19th and 20th centuries, attracted people from all over the world seeking the American dream. In contrast, Guangzhou, the capital of China’s Guangdong province, offers a glimpse into the future of globalization.
It’s no coincidence that this city is in China, the country that best exemplifies the world’s ongoing transition. In roughly 50 years, China has transformed from one of the poorest countries to the world’s second-largest economy. It has become a land of opportunity too, drawing individuals from diverse regions, especially those left out of today’s globalization benefits.
Guangzhou, the urban center of the Pearl River Delta, is renowned for its multiculturalism – a stark contrast to the rest of China, which has a lower percentage of foreign residents than even North Korea. Entrepreneurs from Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, Pakistan, and Iraq can be found in the city.

Foreigners have long been part of Guangzhou’s history, dating back to when it was a major port on the ancient Silk Road. The maritime route connecting Guangzhou to the Persian Gulf via the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean was the world’s most important at that time. Today, Guangzhou is a key hub for purchasing low-cost goods, often counterfeit, exported to South and Southeast Asia, Latin America, and predominantly the Middle East and Africa.
“If you go to Shanghai, you’ll find more Europeans and Americans; big business happens there. Here, we do things on a smaller scale, buying some goods and reselling them back home,” Ahmed told me in an Arab restaurant in Xiaobei, a district in Guangzhou.
Ahmed, an Ethiopian, has been traveling between Addis Ababa and Guangzhou for about 20 years. He knows China well and loves it, particularly appreciating “the safety and the freedom to be who you want to be, thanks to the many opportunities China offers.” That phrase had a strong flavor of the old American dream but with a Chinese twist.
Over the years, Xiaobei has emerged as “Little Africa,” becoming the focal point of the African community in Guangzhou, which is the largest in Asia. Many Middle Eastern men and women also live there. Providing an exact number is nearly impossible, both because the government does not release such data and due to the often transient nature of foreigners’ stays in the city.

Ten years ago, there were an estimated 500,000 foreigners in Guangzhou. By 2018, this number had decreased to around 80,000. The headcount has fluctuated over time, but the pandemic drastically reduced it. During the two years of China’s zero-COVID policy, many foreigners faced extreme precariousness due to the lack of Chinese citizenship. The inability to conduct their businesses, the main reason for being in Guangzhou, forced them to return home.
Contributing to their departure was also a rise in racism reported after the COVID-19 pandemic began. Many Africans reported being targeted with suspicion and subjected to forced evictions and arbitrary quarantines. The pandemic was indeed a turning point.
I visited Guangzhou this July to see how the Arab and African presence in the city had changed. Two years after China reopened, Xiaobei remains the emblematic Arab-African district, but with a significant difference: few foreigners now live there year-round. Most individuals only remain for a few months, which is sufficient time to conduct their business.
Citizens from Arab and African countries primarily occupy hotels and hostels. In the hostel where I was staying, I met Hassam, a Sudanese man who has been coming to China for over a decade. He is fluent in Mandarin and has studied computer science in Beijing. After living in various Chinese cities, he now has an import-export business.

The ongoing vitality and dynamism of trade between Guangzhou and African and Middle Eastern countries are evident from the numerous street signs advertising shipping services, even door-to-door, from China to Iraq or Nigeria.
Among the remaining Africans residing in the city, the majority are affluent and may not be actively engaged in business. This is the case for Abdel, who came from Tanzania and is studying mechanical engineering. His parents moved to China five years ago for work-related reasons. However, he plans to graduate and move to “somewhere in Europe or Canada” because, he says, China now offers fewer opportunities than when his family first arrived. Additionally, it’s not easy being an African in China; he often faces discrimination, and the language barrier has limited his friendships to those in his international university program.
Even with the major changes brought about by the pandemic, Guangzhou still showcases a unique form of globalization. It reflects a grassroots globalization marked by independent traders who buy goods in large quantities and sell them in their home countries through official retail stores and informal street markets. The city on the Pearl River reflects how many emerging economies view China: abundant in opportunity and a paradigm of development and modernity, different from European or American models.
These micro-level dynamics mirror the macro-level, where China cultivates political and economic relationships with emerging economies. Today, Beijing is the primary trading partner for most emerging African and Middle Eastern economies. Its role as a central hub and driving force of an alternative form of globalization is well represented by the Belt and Road Initiative, the cornerstone of China’s economic and geopolitical strategy, which aims to promote its standards globally, both financial and political. It’s no coincidence that most countries involved in the Chinese project are emerging economies, with crucial nodes in the Middle East and Africa.
Over the past decade, through economic influence, soft power, political pressure, and diplomatic initiatives, China has advanced its worldview, offering it to countries where the West’s appeal has been undermined by years of exploitation and paternalism. In many cases, the Chinese charm offensive is working.

Securing America’s Critical Minerals: A Policy Priority Conundrum,https://thediplomat.com/2024/08/securing-americas-critical-minerals-a-policy-priority-conundrum/,"“When I think about climate change, I think jobs,” U.S. President Joe Biden has repeatedly said. His landmark Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) embodies this idea, tying together U.S. climate and industrial policies with a vast array of subsidies aimed at sparking a green manufacturing boom. Built into these subsidies are mechanisms to secure U.S. supply chains and to shore up domestic manufacturing, which has atrophied in recent decades, strategic priorities that Biden inherited from his predecessor, Donald Trump.
Although recent U.S. policymaking has exhibited a hyperfocus on supply chain security for semiconductors and other dual-use items, an area of equal – arguably greater – strategic significance is the supply of critical minerals, the building blocks of most advanced technologies, including those with military application.
Ever-present, but often unspoken, in Washington’s supply chain strategy is China. From the nickel used in fighter jet engines to the rare earth elements used in wind turbines, China’s dominance in the global supply of critical minerals presents a potential chokehold on U.S. industry. China accounts for 77 percent of the world’s refined cobalt, 65 percent of its chemical lithium, and 91 percent of its battery-grade graphite. All three minerals are essential for the production of lithium-ion batteries, a key component in the green transition.
China’s market dominance exists in part due to generous state subsidies. Analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies calculates a “conservative estimate” of $230 billion in electric vehicle (EV) subsidies for the period 2009-2023. Increasingly, green technologies are fundamental to Xi Jinping’s “high quality growth” strategy, which aims to spur high-productivity advanced manufacturing sectors amid a broader slump in the Chinese economy.
Critical minerals sit at the intersection of three policy objectives for the United States. First, policymakers must ensure national security. If China were to cut off supply of critical minerals, it could devastate the U.S. economy, with particular impacts for the manufacture of advanced technologies, including those with military application. This is why the U.S. is seeking to decouple and reshore supply chains. Second, policymakers are seeking to revive the U.S. manufacturing sector and catalyze job creation by embracing fast-growing green industries, in particular the EV sector. Third, policymakers are addressing the climate crisis by accelerating the rollout of green technologies.
Although these three policy objectives are not directly in competition with one another, their implementation can lead to contradictory, even dysfunctional, outcomes.
The IRA, alongside the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the CHIPS and Science Act, ostensibly aims to address these three policy objectives in one fell swoop. A fundamental challenge is that U.S. industry, and that of Western allies more broadly, has struggled to compete with the low prices of Chinese producers, and the price gap is only getting wider. In theory, a balanced diet of policies that would correct the market distortions of Chinese subsidies (and the resultant oversupply that has flooded international markets) would be the ideal solution to safeguard U.S. green technology growth, but this is difficult. To de-risk supply chains and build up capacity – whether this be domestic or “friendshored” – requires a step incompatible with a genuine commitment to a global green transition: the exclusion, at least to some degree, of cheap Chinese green technologies from U.S. markets.
China is equally weaponizing supply chains, and nowhere is this clearer than in the area of critical minerals. Beijing has proved willing to employ export controls in pursuit of geopolitical ends, most notably following a 2010 diplomatic incident with Japan over the contested Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. Most recently in 2023, Chinese restrictions on gallium and germanium exports, as well as greater export controls on high-grade graphite, have rung alarm bells.
The Three Competing Policy Imperatives
The contradictions between the competing objectives of security, jobs and growth, and climate, and the resulting policy pathologies, play out in the detail of policy. The IRA’s headline green policy is the landmark $7,500 EV consumer tax credit (known as “30D”). To qualify, EVs must be manufactured in North America, and the batteries must be 60 percent produced in the United States or countries with which the U.S. has free trade agreements.
Security: The tip of the spear for U.S. security incentives in the IRA are the requirements relating to “foreign entities of concern” (FEOCs). FEOCs are those entities – usually companies – based in or otherwise controlled by “covered nations”: China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran. EVs with batteries or battery components manufactured by an FEOC are excluded from the 30D tax credit. From 2025, the requirements will expand to include critical minerals produced by an FEOC, effectively excluding China from any part of the EV supply chain. Separately, the Defense Production Act was invoked by both Trump and Biden to include rare earth elements and battery minerals, opening up a range of policy levers for increasing domestic production in the name of national security.
Jobs and growth: The 30D tax credit also includes a sourcing requirement that eligible EVs are manufactured in North America and that the batteries must be at least 60 percent produced in the U.S. or partner countries with which the U.S. has free trade agreements, ensuring U.S. manufacturers are likely to benefit at all stages of the supply chain. Somewhat confusingly, however, the investment tax credit (under Section 48C) and the production tax credit (under Section 45X) for renewables, batteries, and critical minerals do not include the same FEOC restrictions. If Chinese companies were to invest, this disconnect leaves open the scenario that batteries subsidized by Section 48C or 45X couldn’t be used in EVs seeking to qualify for the tax credit under Section 30D.
Green transition: Policymakers have also been forced to carve out exemptions to these requirements, lest they throttle mid- to down-stream production. Graphite, over 90 percent of which is produced in China, is excluded from the FEOC requirements of 30D in recognition of the limited domestic capacity. Indeed, U.S. domestic graphite production was non-existent until only February this year, when Syrah Resources commenced production at a facility in Louisiana. Likewise, tariffs on graphite and permanent magnets for EVs will not be implemented until 2026, indicating continued dependency on China.
Yet, in a nod to competition with China over its burgeoning EV industry, Chinese EVs will this year face a 100 percent tariff, with tariffs on solar cells and EV lithium-ion batteries rising to 50 percent and 25 percent, respectively, in an attempt to insulate U.S. industry from a “China Shock 2.0.”
These are just some examples of an increasingly complex regulatory web in which competing and overlapping policy tools are inadvertently hampering U.S. grand strategy. Such dysfunctionality is also doing harm to business where confidence is everything.
In the particular area of critical minerals, a balance must be struck in between the green transition and protectionist decoupling. Tariffs and exclusion from subsidies serve primarily to exclude China from supply chains, going beyond simply leveling the playing field. Although the Biden administration has carefully considered climate goals, we should be honest that protectionism and national security have remained priorities.
What’s in a Name?
The blurring of policy priorities is partly a definitional issue. The term “critical minerals” disguises the question: critical for what? Critical minerals required for sustaining armed conflict are overlapping but distinct from those required for the green transition. Generally defined by their economic significance and their risk of supply chain disruption, lists of critical minerals vary in length and composition across jurisdictions.
This broad definition can lead to somewhat inconsistent categorization. Take nickel and rare earth metals, both categorized as critical minerals. For the former, Indonesia is the leading producer; China produces 28 percent of global processed supply. For the latter, China produces 92 percent of global refined supply. The former is used primarily in lithium-ion batteries, as well as superalloys with military and aviation applications. The latter is used in wind turbines, lasers, electronics, and guidance systems. It is challenging to produce a coherent geopolitical strategy for a sector that encompasses such a range of characteristics.
If the effectiveness of Chinese export restrictions on critical minerals is likely to be limited, what else is driving U.S. policy? We have two suggestions. First, U.S. policymakers fear a conflict scenario with China in which the IRA and other policies have failed to build up sufficient domestic capacity, and U.S. military industrial capacity is left crippled by an embargo. Amid rising concerns over Xi Jinping’s intentions for Taiwan and bullish Chinese behavior in the contested waters of the South China Sea, a conflict scenario appears ever more real. However, as aforementioned, critical minerals for a conflict don’t necessarily reflect the minerals essential for the green transition.
Instead, perhaps this is an example of what Graham Allison called the “Thucydides Trap.” The term refers to the structural stresses at play when a hegemon is challenged by a rising power. A sense of insecurity felt by the ruling power pushes it to behave in ways that escalate tensions with the rising power. China’s dominance in critical minerals and green technology is a significant issue, but we should recognize that U.S. grand strategy is also about addressing the broader symbolism of industrial strength in today’s great power rivalry.
A Change of Guard?
A tight presidential race in the United States makes it difficult to draw long-term predictions over policy direction in the area of critical minerals. A proper understanding of the three objectives of the IRA and other legislation provides some insight into the possible fate of these policies should Vice President Kamala Harris lose.
Trump has repeatedly called climate change a “hoax,” and the green transition is not an area he would be likely to prioritize. Nevertheless, the securitization of critical mineral supply chains has been a unique point of continuity between Trump and Biden. Indeed, the IRA can be understood as a soft-spoken continuation of Trump’s “America First” protectionism. We can expect such efforts to be turned back up to eleven if Trump returns to the White House; he recently mooted a 60 percent blanket tariff on Chinese goods.
An instinct for destruction of his predecessor’s policy innovations might blind Trump to the synergies between his platform and various Biden-era policies. Nonetheless, the outsized share of green tech investment received by GOP districts provides a major incentive for a Republican Congress to support the IRA, or at least elements of it. During an attempt to repeal parts of the IRA in 2023, the Republican-controlled House Ways and Means Committee spared a tax credit for producing batteries and components. Indeed, given bipartisan support for mining subsidies, a Trump administration might well focus on expanding FEOC regulations and curbing EV credits.
Some remain hopeful that green industry has reached a tipping point where growth continues without government support. We must hope this is true. The world cannot afford to slow the green transition, nor can we afford an escalation with China; getting critical minerals wrong would be disastrous for both scenarios.

How Bangladesh’s Quota Reform Protest Turned Into a Mass Uprising Against a ‘Killer Government’,https://thediplomat.com/2024/08/how-bangladeshs-quota-reform-protest-turned-into-a-mass-uprising-against-a-killer-government/,"At Jahangirnagar University, on the outskirts of Dhaka, Professor Shamima Sultana, head of the Bangla Department, took down a portrait of Sheikh Hasina from her office wall, challenging established norms.
“I refuse to display the picture of a murderer [Hasina], who is responsible for my child’s [student’s] blood,” she wrote in a Facebook post.
For the past two weeks, the South Asian nation home to around 170 million, has been in a state of upheaval. What began as a student protest for reforming the government job quota system has now drawn people from all walks of life onto the streets and evolved into a mass uprising, with many calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
“There are no ifs and buts anymore,” declared Nazia Andalib, an aspiring poet and NGO worker. “This is no longer just a quota reform movement. It’s a movement against Hasina and her oppressive government. She must resign now.”
The protesters got their wish on Monday, when Hasina resigned and fled the country after protesters stormed her official residence.
How did a student-led demand for quota reform in the civil service escalate into a country-wide movement that ended Hasina’s 15-year reign?
During the earlier phase of the protests, from July 15-22, when students were on the streets demanding quota reform, the government responded with measures as severe as a “shoot-on-sight” order – resulting in reports of over 200 deaths and thousands of injuries.
A nationwide curfew was imposed with military patrols and no internet access. In between, the apex court slashed the government job quotas from 56 percent to 7 percent in an attempt to appease protesters.
Yet given the violence that had gone before, this concession failed to satisfy the nation. Protesters called for nine specific demands, which included an apology from Hasina and the resignation of six Cabinet ministers.
“The irony is that a political party with over a decade and a half of ruling experience believed that a mere reform could pacify the deep-seated frustration caused by Hasina’s numerous wrongdoings,” said political analyst Zahed Ur Rahman. “The latest of which is Hasina’s refusal to acknowledge her mistakes, including allowing police and party members to use brutal force against students and ordinary citizens, resulting in hundreds of deaths.”
Rather than apologize, however, the Hasina government doubled down on its suppression. After the initial wave of protests, the government’s heavy-handed tactics, including “block raids” against students and the arrest of at least 10,372 people nationwide – along with the arbitrary detention of an unverified number of individuals without charges – only intensified public anger.
Despite the climate of fear instilled by mass arrests, student protesters remained defiant. They launched fresh programs like the “March for Justice” and “Remembering our heroes,” calling for demonstrations at educational institutions, court premises, and major roads nationwide to push home their nine-point demands.
Defying monsoon rains, students gathered in large numbers across the capital on Friday, some clad in raincoats and holding umbrellas, while others remained drenched yet steadfast in their protests.
“What was Mughda’s fault? What was the fault of that little girl who was standing on the balcony? What crime did so many innocent people commit to deserve such death? Why were they killed so brutally? We demand justice for every one of these murders,” said a 12th-standard student whose board exam is now postponed.
As the marches continued, the tone of slogans now escalated to directly calling Sheikh Hasina a dictator – a once unthinkable action.
“Who came? Who came? The police came, the police came. What are they doing? They are here to lick the dictator’s feet,” chanted some female students while police forces were standing upfront in the northern district of Thakurgaon. 

“She [Hasina] is using bullets bought with our tax money to shoot us. This country doesn’t belong to anyone’s father; it belongs to all of us,” said one female student, speaking to national televisions during a protest amid incessant rain in the capital’s Uttara.
In southeastern Chattogram, an ocean of protesters chanted slogans in Bengali:, “Down with autocracy, let democracy be free,” “1, 2, 3, 4….Sheikh Hasina dictator,” “What do we want? Resignation…One demand, one condition. Resignation, resignation.”
The internet was flooded with calls for “one point, one demand: the resignation of killer Hasina” as reports of police and ruling party men attacking peaceful protesters came in. All told, around 300 people have been killed in the violence, including almost 100 on Sunday alone.
The hashtag #StepDownHasina began trending on X (formerly Twitter), with over 80,000 posts expressing disapproval of the government.
Graffiti, artworks, festoons, and banners all reflect widespread disapproval of the incumbent government.
In the capital’s outskirts, at Jahangirnagar University, students and teachers defied the pouring rain to stage protest marches on Thursday with songs of resistance, drama, and performance art.
“Our demands are clear: the fall of a dictator, fulfilment of our nine-point demands, and justice for our brothers whose blood stained the streets,” said Prapti Taposhi, a student activist.
“Until all these demands are fulfilled, we won’t leave the streets,” she added.
As the protests changed focus, support for the movement surged, drawing in tens of thousands of people. Teachers, actors, and citizens from various walks of life joined students in their demonstrations.
Teachers have been reported obstructing police from detaining students, with many arguing with officers for their release.
Some of these confrontations have resulted in scuffles, with media reports indicating that two female teachers from Dhaka University were hit by police while trying to block their students’ detention – which sparked widespread condemnation as many questioned the audacity of police laying hands on a female university teacher.
“They kill our sons [students], beat them, they do not even spare the female ones and illegally detain them. As their teachers, we cannot tolerate this. Where does a policeman get the audacity to strike a university teacher?” Shamima Sultana, the professor who removed Hasina’s portrait from her office, told The Diplomat.
The killings that occurred during the quota reform protests were “state-sponsored acts carried out by government forces and their allies,” condemned Professor Salimullah Khan, an eminent scholar and thinker, while he was leading a group of university teachers to a demonstration in the capital.
“Do any of you believe that this government can deliver justice while in power? They will not seek justice for these killings because this government is the killer. How can you ask a killer to deliver justice for their massacre?” he questioned.
He emphasized the need for a political solution, stating, “The first step is for the current government to unconditionally apologize and resign. Without the government’s resignation, we cannot move forward to any new form of governance.”
Part of that first step has been taken. Hasina resigned on Monday, then boarded a military helicopter, along with her sister, to leave the country. Bangladesh’s military chief, Gen. Waker-uz-Zaman, said he would seek the president’s guidance on forming an interim government.
He promised that the military would launch an investigation into the deadly crackdown on student-led protests that fueled outrage against the government.
“Keep faith in the military, we will investigate all the killings and punish the responsible,” he said. “I have ordered that no army and police will indulge in any kind of firing.”
“Now, the students’ duty is to stay calm and help us,” he added.
Now the question is what the military’s promised investigation will yield. Hasina’s government had steadfastly blamed the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami party for the unrest.
In a recent sitting with Indian High Commissioner Pranay Verma, Hasina likened this student-led protest to “almost a terrorist attack,” alleging it aimed to create unrest similar to Sri Lanka’s.
In response, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir accused the government of deepening its crisis by becoming a “public enemy” through what he described as “genocide” to suppress the student protests, reported The Daily Star. He also called for the government to resign immediately.
This protest was the first major challenge to hit the Hasina administration, which has been in office since 2009.
Critics have long accused Hasina’s government of authoritarianism, corruption, and rigging the last three general elections – a claim the ruling party vehemently denies.
Asif Nazrul, an acclaimed political analyst and professor at Dhaka University, painted a broader picture of the reasons for public disapproval of the ruling government. “Consider the current living standards: inflation and food prices have soared dramatically, with food inflation at 10.76 percent and overall inflation exceeding 9 percent for nearly a year,” he noted.
“Recently, there have been reports of leaked civil service exam questions and numerous government officials involved in widespread corruption. Now, the severe mishandling of a student-led protest, which led to over 200 deaths, adds to the discontent. It is clear that public trust in this government has completely eroded,” the Nazrul remarked.
Since the protest movement began, the country’s economic woes have only deepened as many expatriates reportedly launched a boycott campaign to shake the Hasina government, urging people not to send remittances through official banking channels. Supporters of the boycott said their hard-earned money was being used to purchase bullets to kill their countrymen.
According to Bangladesh Bank data, remittance inflows, the South Asian nation’s second-biggest source of foreign currency, dropped to $1.9 billion in July from $2.54 billion in June.
Experts fear that the ongoing tensions could adversely impact exports, foreign trade, and foreign direct investments, further deepening the ongoing dollar shortage.
With Hasina gone, the protesters are celebrating – and reportedly looting her official residence. Now the big question is what comes next for a country that has known only Hasina’s increasingly tight-fisted rule for the past 15 years.

"International Airlines Leave China, Despite Beijing’s Urging",https://thediplomat.com/2024/08/international-airlines-leave-china-despite-beijings-urging/,"The pandemic shut down global travel for much of the world, and especially for China, which imposed some of the tightest and longest-lasting restrictions on international arrivals. The result was a cratering number of flights to and from China. When Beijing lifted its restrictions in 2023, the hope was that the menu of international flights would rapidly increase. That hasn’t happened – and in fact, some of the airlines that did resume flights to China are now pulling back out.
This is partly for reasons outside of China’s control. The global aviation industry has been divided into two camps: Those airlines that are permitted to fly over Russia, and those that aren’t. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, much of the world has placed sanctions on Vladimir Putin’s government. In return, Putin has slapped no-overfly sanctions on airline companies from the nations that have sanctioned Russia.
The practical effect of Russia’s move to deny international carriers access to its airspace is that most of the European countries that would normally use routes that fly over Russia in order to reach China and other East Asian countries are now forced to use longer and therefore more expensive southern routes that skirt the Black Sea and the Russian border, and cross the Caspian right through the middle. Such adjustments are costing customers one to four hours of extra flying time, and airlines extra crew and fuel costs.
The fallout and to some extent the benefit is mostly focused on China. Rather than trying to out-compete Chinese airlines, which Russia has not sanctioned and which are therefore welcome to fly over Russian airspace, several major international airlines have decided to just drop their direct flights to mainland China altogether.
That there is a political component in this shake-up is inarguable. However, the airline Virgin Atlantic, whose last flight from Shanghai into London will be on October 26 of this year, strongly defends its decision as solely based on business criteria.
Virgin Atlantic, Richard Branson’s upstart airline that since the 1980s has dared to challenge the supremacy of flag-carrier British Airlines, cited “purely commercial” reasons for its departure from the mainland Chinese market.
Noting Virgin Atlantic’s strong fan base, and its probable willingness to absorb longer flight times and some extra cost if necessary, The Diplomat asked the airline if there are “any reasons other than commercial considerations that influenced the decision of Virgin Atlantic to cancel the London to Shanghai route?”
A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson told The Diplomat that “significant challenges and complexities on this route have contributed to the commercial decision to suspend flying to Shanghai.” In particular, the spokesperson said, “Operations have become increasingly costly due to increased flight times as we are not able to overfly Russia.”
In other words, the commercial decision is indeed a result of a larger political environment over which Virgin has little control.
Virgin is not alone. Qantas, Australia’s flag carrier, has also just ended its Sydney to Shanghai route. Qantas’ problem has nothing to do with a flight path over unsafe and unwelcome space, however. Instead, it’s motivated by a lack of demand – something probably linked to increased tensions between China and Australia.
Qantas International CEO Cam Wallace told The Diplomat, “Since COVID, the demand for travel between Australia and China has not recovered as strongly as expected. In some months, our flights to and from Shanghai have been operating around half full.”
Starting from July 28, Qantas’ flights to Shanghai were suspended due to flagging demand.
Moving forward, Wallace said, “We’ll continue to maintain a presence in China through our partners and our existing flights to Hong Kong and look to return to Shanghai in the future.”
Both Virgin and Qantas cited commercial rationales for grounding their flights. India, however, is quick to assert that its direct-to-China flights, which ceased four years ago, will remain grounded for the foreseeable future – and the reason seems to be entirely and unashamedly political.
India and China have had no direct flights since 2020, when a border dispute that has overshadowed the India-China relationship for decades flared up into a deadly clash in the Galwan Valley. The situation remains unresolved and tense, with thousands of troops mobilized on both sides.
Reuters reported last month that airlines from both nations are “talking” with their respective governments. China has been pushing India to open up direct flights, but so far the Indian government hasn’t budged. Indian officials cited in the piece repeated New Delhi’s mantra that “Unless there is peace and tranquility on the border, the rest of the relationship cannot move forward.”
If the absence of direct passenger flights has in any way mirrored or paralleled the relationship status of the countries which are shutting down their direct flights to China, it doesn’t seem to be across the board.
Virgin pulled its China route because it was unprofitable due to the ban on using Russian airspace. Qantas shut down its last route into China because demand did not return after COVID-19. And India has dug in its heels, it seems, vetoing a resumption of direct flights for purely political reasons – yet it continues a thriving bilateral trade with China despite their deep diplomatic divisions.
As Shreya Upadhyay wrote for The Diplomat in May 2024, “In fiscal year 2024, bilateral trade between the two nations reached $118.4 billion, with India heavily reliant on China for critical products such as telecom and smartphone parts, pharmaceuticals, and advanced technology components.”
The “decoupling” of these direct flight routes does, however, brings into question China’s evolving relationship with the world. The situation makes it easier for the foreign community to seek out other destinations – and perhaps even other investment opportunities at the same time. Note that Qantas is substituting the Sydney to Shanghai route with a Brisbane to Manila route; the Philippines is always eager for foreign investment.
At the same time, it reinforces China’s always present instinct to isolate, to turn inward again.  As one Chinese contact told me upon hearing of the theme of this article, these foreign airlines “may receive a thank you letter from China, for helping keep our people at home.”

The Silent Winner of Myanmar’s Northern Conflict,https://thediplomat.com/2024/07/the-silent-winner-of-myanmars-northern-conflict/,"On the morning of July 28, a convoy of soldiers from the United Wa State Army (UWSA) drove through Lashio, the capital of the northern Shan State and home of the Myanmar military’s Northeastern Regional Command, taking control of the administration under the pretext of peacekeeping. This occurred amid renewed fighting in northern Shan State, as the Three Brotherhood Alliance of ethnic armed groups launched the second phase of its Operation 1027 offensive, massing their forces around Lashio. Without firing a single shot, the UWSA has gained control of three additional townships in Shan State since October 2023 – Hopang, Pan Lon, and Tangyan – and likely more in the coming weeks.
Sources in Naypyidaw indicate that the military State Administration Council (SAC) has agreed to have the UWSA and Shan State Progress Party (SSPP) step in as peacekeepers to prevent the renewed conflict from spilling over into other parts of Shan State. This indicates the SAC’s inability to maintain control and the potential total collapse of its authority in northern Shan State. The key question is: what are the strategic aims and implications of the UWSA’s entry into Lashio? To answer that question, here are five things you need to know about the UWSA, what it stands to gain from the northern conflict, and the broader regional implications.
A Role Model and Political Leadership
As the largest of Myanmar’s ethnic armed groups, the UWSA, which controls two non-contiguous territories in Shan State and has as many as 30,000 soldiers under arms, is widely viewed as a model and a source of inspiration for other ethnic organizations in Myanmar. “We have ambitions that are nothing less than Wa State,” said Twan Mrat Naing, leader of the Arakan Army (AA), during celebrations marking the 30th anniversary of the UWSA’s founding in Pangsang, the UWSA’s capital, in 2019. Newly formed ethnic armed groups are now drawing similar inspiration from the AA and its battlefield successes in Rakhine State since the launch of Operation 1027.
The UWSA has also established itself as a political leader among the 20-odd ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) in Myanmar. At the 21st Century Panglong Peace Conference convened by Aung San Suu Kyi’s government in 2017, the group submitted a proposal for a confederation model as part of an ethnic coalition known as the Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative Committee (FPNCC). Led by the UWSA, the FPNCC’s policy reflects the interests of the UWSA in two key ways: first, it advocates self-determination and authority over local security forces within designated areas until the establishment of a future federal system; and second, it advocates the creation of a security system that prioritizes local authorities and the self-defense of autonomous states through the formation of ethnic armies. This forms the foundational document of its political leadership. This significant demand for a parallel peace and political dialogue process in 2017 seemed ambitious at the time. However, seven years after the proposal, with the central administration at its weakest in decades and ready to negotiate, it appears achievable.
The FPNCC, which also includes the AA, SSPP, Kachin Independence Army (KIA), Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), National Democratic Alliance Army (NDAA), and Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), is now Myanmar’s largest ethnic coalition. It includes more than half of all EAO combatants in Myanmar and operates from the banks of the Mekong River to the Bay of Bengal. The FPNCC has held regular meetings since the 2021 coup, with a clear framework and vision and clear political demands. Since the military takeover, no other ethnic coalition has hosted summits or regular meetings on this scale or presented a clear political position like the FPNCC. De facto leadership of the FPNCC has made the UWSA the most politically influential armed group in Myanmar, a role historically contested by the Karen National Union and the KIA.
The existing FPNCC’s political framework differs significantly from the federal charter formulated by the opposition National Unity Government (NUG) and National Unity Consultative Council (NUCC). This difference is evident not only in the political process, but also in terms of fundamental visions, security arrangements, and relationship with the union administration. With its strength and influence, the FPNCC is unlikely to agree to participate in either junta or NUG processes, instead choosing to chart its own course.
Wa State and Vision
Using the FPNCC as a platform, the UWSA has aligned its political aspirations with the FPNCC’s principles. In addition to this, the UWSA submitted two other documents in 2017: a proposal for a consultation process with the Myanmar government over the creation of an autonomous Wa State from the territories under the UWSA’s control and a proposal for a new ceasefire agreement. These documents illustrate the UWSA’s inspiration and vision for Wa State.
These proposals left open the question of what exactly constitutes Wa State. This has again become a live question in the current context, which the UWSA is hoping it can use to extend its territory as much as possible. Taking advantage of the weak central administration, it has already created buffer areas around UWSA-administered areas. The critical issue is whether it can link the central Wa State, which lies along the border with China, with southern Wa State, along the Thai border, over which it established control in the 1990s while fighting against a Shan insurgency alongside the Myanmar military. In its 2017 proposal for a new Wa State, the UWSA requested the inclusion of Kengtung township in eastern Shan State.  This would link the southern and central Wa States, turning the eastern part of Shan State into an exclave under direct UWSA control. The UWSA attempted this territorial expansion in 2016. In September of that year, a force of 1,000 UWSA troops marched toward Mong La, an area under the control of the NDAA, creating tensions with the NDAA. A settlement with the NDAA was reached following talks between the UWSA leadership and Aung San Suu Kyi’s government.
All of this is to say that the UWSA’s territorial ambitions extend beyond the current status quo. Linking the southern and northern parts of Wa State is a crucial aim. Having been granted permission by the SAC to mobilize in northern Shan State, the UWSA will undoubtedly seize the opportunity to expand its areas of influence and control. Given these territorial aspirations, and the UWSA’s influence over the Three Brotherhood Alliance, particularly the MNDAA, since the start of Operation 1027, the UWSA now exerts possibly decisive influence in a long arc from the China-Myanmar border in the north of Shan State to the Thailand-Myanmar border in the south. This makes it the most influential and capable EAO in Myanmar’s modern history.
The Strategic Stalemate
In making its decisions, the UWSA has tended to act cautiously. In general, it has sought to maintain the status quo between the central administration, rival EAOs, and China. This strategic posture has been evident in its response to the coup and Operation 1027 offensive. While not directly involved, the UWSA has indirectly supported the MNDAA during the operation, for which the MNDAA leadership expressed gratitude in January.
By avoiding conflict with the SAC and maintaining its distance from the NUG, the UWSA has upheld its neutrality, at least officially. This neutrality has allowed the UWSA to increase its influence amidst the stalemate in the Shan State, not only among FPNCC members but also with those in southern Myanmar that are seeking supplies and arms. By preserving a relationship with the military junta and avoiding outright conflict, the UWSA’s strategic approach seems to have paid off, positioning it as a leading political entity in northern Myanmar. This unique position allows it to mediate the relations between various EAOs and the junta administration, as evidenced by the SAC’s request for the UWSA to deploy its forces in Tangyan and now in Lashio.
Despite the UWSA’s entry into Lashio, its FPNCC allies, particularly the MNDAA, are continuing their siege of the city, and the TNLA persists in its offensive in northern Shan State and parts of Mandalay Region. The critical question is whether the UWSA will allow its own alliance to become uncontrollable, potentially challenging its political influence and disrupting the new status quo. Alternatively, the UWSA might seek to maintain a stalemate in northern Shan State. Regardless of its chosen path, it is certain that the UWSA will continue to have a significant impact on Myanmar politics for the foreseeable future.
New Leadership, Rising Kingdom
The UWSA’s strategic shift is being driven by a new generation of leaders. Young and energetic leaders in their 30s and early 40s, including Zhao Ai Nap Lai (son of Zhao Nyi-lai) and Bao Ai Kham (son of Bao Youxiang), were introduced in strategic meetings with the MNDAA in April. Zhao Ai Nap Lai has succeeded his father as general secretary and head of the Politburo, while Bao Ai Kham is the UWSA’s new deputy general secretary.
These leaders, part of the generation that witnessed the fall of the Communist Party of Burma (from which the UWSA was created in 1989), bring different visions, views, and objectives. They lead the UWSA with heightened nationalism, seeking to preserve their legacy while seizing any opportunities that present themselves. However, their political ambitions may necessitate a recalibration of the UWSA’s decades-long strategy of maintaining the status quo and stalemate in the region, given the evolving political and regional context.
As China’s power grows and Myanmar’s central administration weakens, the UWSA is actively seeking a new status quo that can maximize its influence. This context is reminiscent of the rise of new kingdoms. With substantial tin deposits, rare earth elements, control over a critical juncture of Southeast Asia’s largest drug trafficking route, and the ability to produce small arms, the UWSA possesses the resources needed to achieve its strategic goals. Importantly, the Wa State territories straddle the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor and are relevant to the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation platform, both of which are crucial to China’s strategic expansion in mainland Southeast Asia.
Influencing and Threats to Thailand
Given that it is considered a natural ally of China, the UWSA maintains a close relationship with Beijing and the provincial administration in Yunnan. The UWSA’s influence in the heart of the Mekong region extends Chinese influence deep into Myanmar and down to the border with Thailand.
As the UWSA grows more powerful, its political model will become more attractive to other EAOs. If Chinese efforts to mediate the current conflict secure formal autonomy and territorial concessions for the UWSA, other groups along Myanmar’s borders might adopt the UWSA’s approach and choose to come under greater Chinese influence. This development could undermine all dialogue processes initiated by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) or the establishment of local administrative processes by the NUG and other ethnic Interim Executive Councils, which enjoy the backing of Western countries. The UWSA’s expansion along the Thai-Myanmar border means that states and entities influenced by China could soon surround Thailand. This new player in the region poses a critical question: Is Thailand, the last remaining U.S. ally in mainland Southeast Asia, prepared for this expansion?

First Known Survivor of China’s Forced Organ Harvesting Speaks Out,https://thediplomat.com/2024/08/first-known-survivor-of-chinas-forced-organ-harvesting-speaks-out/,"In a chilling revelation that underscores the ongoing atrocities committed under the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Mr. Cheng Pei Ming, the first known survivor of China’s state-sanctioned forced organ harvesting campaign, spoke to journalist Tasnim Nazeer for The Diplomat about his survival against the odds.
Cheng publicly shared his harrowing experience at a press conference in Washington, D.C., on Friday, exposing his story and the ongoing forced organ harvesting that is taking place in China. His testimony offered a rare and disturbing glimpse into the horrors faced by prisoners of conscience in China, particularly practitioners of Falun Gong. Cheng is said to be the only known survivor of China’s forced organ harvesting, and his testimony is unprecedented in exposing the hidden horrors of the brutal industry.
A Brutal Ordeal
Cheng, who hails from a rural village in Shandong Province, was repeatedly detained and tortured between 1999 and 2004 for practicing Falun Gong, a spiritual practice rooted in Buddhist traditions. The Chinese Communist Party, which views Falun Gong as a threat to its authoritarian rule, has branded Falun Gong a dangerous cult and has systematically persecuted its adherents for decades.
Speaking from inside a car in Washington, D.C., Cheng told me, “One day in 2002, I was told to pack up and was suddenly transferred to Harbin Prison and later to Daqing Prison. It was there that I was tortured even more severely.”
Cheng recalled the escalating brutality he faced in detention. In a particularly harrowing episode, he was tortured to the point of losing consciousness. “On November 17, 2004, I was tortured again until I passed out. When I woke up, I found myself tied to a hospital bed.”
Here, his account takes an even more disturbing turn. “I remember being tied to a bed in the hospital,” Cheng said. “The doctors and several of the ‘610 Office’ officials were there.” The 610 office is a notorious secretive and powerful organization within the CCP, tasked with implementing the crackdown on the Falun Gong.
“They said that I had to undergo an operation, but I firmly refused. They gave me an injection, and I quickly lost consciousness,” Cheng recounted. “When I woke up, I was still in the hospital and felt terrible pain in my side. There was a bloody tube connected to me. I was shackled to the bed.”
This was not an isolated incident. Cheng endured repeated procedures, all under the threat of death. “A few days later, they said I had to have another operation. I thought I was going to die “ he said.
During his imprisonment, Cheng was subjected to forced blood tests – an ominous indicator of his organs’ viability for transplantation. “They did blood tests on me many times and subjected me to all kinds of inhumane torture,” he noted.
“The torture in the prison was very systematic. One was mental and the other was physical [torture]. Mentally they put me and my family members under pressure as they wanted me to give up my faith in Falun Gong and if I didn’t they would force my wife to divorce me when I was in prison.” Cheng was told that if his wife did not divorce him she would face similar persecution as he was facing.
After hours of excruciating torture known as “the big stretch,” during which his limbs were painfully stretched from all corners, Cheng swallowed a small rusty nail and a blunt blade he had found in the torture room. Despite not showing immediate signs of ill health, he was forcibly taken to the hospital on November 16, 2004.
His family was informed that there was an 80 percent mortality rate associated with the operation, supposedly to remove the objects he had swallowed. When Cheng regained consciousness he found himself shackled again to a hospital bed, with an IV tube taped to his foot, a drainage tube in his left chest, oxygen tubes in his nose, and a 35 cm incision on the left side of his chest. Typically, the removal of such objects would be done via endoscopy, but Cheng had undergone open chest surgery.

Following the forced surgery, Cheng was returned to detention at Daqing Prison, where he experienced severe shortness of breath and fatigue. Despite enduring ongoing torture by prison guards for his refusal to renounce Falun Gong, Cheng remained resolute.
In March 2006, he began a hunger strike and was subsequently transferred to Daqing Longnan Hospital. Upon arrival, his sister was present and witnessed Cheng being shackled to a hospital bed. A prison guard informed his sister that Cheng had supposedly ingested a knife and that the surgery required to remove it had an 80 percent mortality rate. This was the second time the family had been given such information, but this time, neither Cheng nor his family were asked to consent to the operation.
Cheng maintains that he had not swallowed any object and had no medical condition necessitating surgery before being forcibly taken to the hospital. He believes that the authorities were planning to kill him.
That night, before the scheduled surgery, Cheng requested to be unshackled to use the restroom across the hall. Upon his return, the guard, having fallen asleep and forgotten to re-shackle him, inadvertently provided him with an opportunity to escape via the hospital’s internal fire stairs.
“I noticed the fire escape on my way to the restroom and I knew where it was so I could use this to try to escape out of the hospital… I ran downstairs and called a cab in front of the hospital and quickly went out of the area into Tianjin city,” he said.
Cheng escaped as a refugee to Thailand where he stayed in a United Nations refugee camp. After a dramatic escape from China and a lengthy nine-year period of evading the authorities, Cheng made it to the United States in 2020.
A Grim Discovery
Once in the U.S., he underwent a series of medical tests that confirmed his worst fears: segments of his liver and a portion of his lung had been surgically removed.
“At that time, I didn’t realize that it was organ harvesting. After undergoing medical tests, I found out that my organs had been harvested,” Cheng explained. “Part of my liver and lungs had been removed. I didn’t even know about it until I was examined in the U.S.”
Transplant specialists have confirmed through recent CT scans that Cheng is missing segments 2 and 3 of his left liver lobe, as well as half of the lower left lobe of his lung. These findings, along with a detailed report on his case, were presented to a panel in Washington D.C.

There have been consistent allegations that China is engaging in forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience – mostly members of Falun Gong, but also Uyghurs and Tibetans – for decades.
In 2021, U.N. human rights experts expressed concern over credible information about the practice. “Forced organ harvesting in China appears to be targeting specific ethnic, linguistic or religious minorities held in detention, often without being explained the reasons for arrest or given arrest warrants, at different locations,” they said. “We are deeply concerned by reports of discriminatory treatment of the prisoners or detainees based on their ethnicity and religion or belief.”
But hard evidence has been hard to come by. Analysts have had to rely on meticulous analysis of China’s organ donation statistics and medical records to investigate the issue.
Cheng’s testimony changes everything.
David Matas, an international human rights lawyer and co-founder of the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China (ETAC), commented on the significance of Cheng’s case:
This particular issue required intensive research, as there are no surviving victims, no bodies to autopsy, and no easily accessible crime scenes or documents… Till now, there has not been anybody who was able to get up and say they have been killed for their organs. The bodies are often cremated after organ harvesting, so there is nothing physically to look at.
Mr. Cheng can say he has been organ harvested as there are parts of his liver and lung that are missing, and it’s incontestable. It provides a visual element, a speaking victim that we’ve never seen before with that type of abuse.
Matas emphasized the unprecedented nature of Cheng’s survival, but also noted that “Mr. Cheng’s survival itself is chilling because it’s the first case I have seen where someone didn’t even know about it until he got to the U.S. and was examined.”
“This case reinforces that Falun Gong practitioners are demonized to the point where they are not treated fairly, and that mistreatment extends to organ harvesting.”
Matas, who has done extensive research into organ harvesting in China, also provided a statement at the press conference that underscored the severity of the situation and sought accountability from the government of China. Matas believes there are over an estimated 100,000 people killed through organ harvesting in China per year.
A Tireless Advocate’s Efforts
Professor Sen Nieh, who has spent decades rescuing prisoners of conscience like Cheng, played a pivotal role in bringing him to the United States. “It started in late 2015 when a friend brought pictures of Mr. Cheng with a long scar on his body and shared his story,” Nieh recalled. “This touched me deeply, and I decided to help him. I visited members of Congress, foreign affairs committees, and senators, many of whom were very touched and wrote letters of support.”
After years of effort and with the support of colleagues, Nieh succeeded in relocating Cheng to the U.S. in July 2020. “He was hiding from the CCP in Bangkok too, and ultimately the rescue took five years. It was a miracle to me; I almost gave up, but it worked out. Mr. Cheng probably was the last group of people who could come to the States before the COVID-19 lockdown.”
Nieh emphasized the importance of Cheng’s testimony, stating, “Nobody knows what we meant by a survivor of forced organ harvesting because 99.9 percent die after being organ harvested. This is the first case we have found of a survivor.”
He further explained the medical evidence: “We have shown all the results that confirm that the left lobe of Mr. Cheng’s liver had been cut, and a small part of his lung had been cut. This case will force the CCP to face the fact that this person is a survivor, and they can no longer deny it.”
A Life Scarred by Injustice
Cheng’s survival, though miraculous, has left him with deep physical and emotional scars. “I’ve lost years of my life, and the fear of being hunted by the CCP never truly goes away,” Cheng admitted, underlining the long-lasting impact of his experience.
“Sometimes, I wake up in the middle of the night, reliving those days in prison. The faces of the guards, the cold sterility of the hospital room, the feeling of utter helplessness – it’s all still so vivid in my mind,” he shared.
Yet, despite everything he has endured, Cheng remains determined to speak out, recalling a pact with other Falun Gong prisoners of conscience back in China. “When I was in China in the prison I had an agreement with other Falun Gong practitioners that whoever would come out alive would tell the world to stop the evil crimes by the CCP, but many of them were already getting killed.”
By providing evidence of forced organ harvesting, “I am not only speaking for myself I am also speaking up for all those who have been tortured to death [by the CCP] who would never have the opportunity to be able to speak again and tell the world what really happened,” Cheng declared.
A Call to Action
As Cheng bravely shares his story with the world, the international community faces a critical moment. The Falun Gong Protection Act, introduced to the U.S. Senate last week, aims to address the crimes of forced organ harvesting in China. The legislation is a vital step in holding the CCP accountable for these heinous acts.
For Nieh and Matas, Cheng’s survival is both a beacon of hope and a stark reminder of the ongoing persecution in China. “Organ harvesting is still happening in China, and it’s not only happening but increasing out of control,” Nieh warned. “Our leaders cannot turn their eyes away.”
Matas echoed this urgency, stating, “We need to understand that forced organ harvesting isn’t just a human rights violation – it’s a crime against humanity. It’s happening on a scale that is almost unimaginable, and it demands a response from the global community.”
Cheng too said he hopes the heinous crime of organ harvesting can be stopped by the international community after hearing his lived experience of it.
“I am one of the lucky ones – I survived. But there are countless others who did not. Their voices were silenced, but I will continue to speak for them. The world needs to know what is happening in China. This evil cannot be allowed to continue.”

Nuclear Shadows Over South Asia: Strategic Instabilities in the China-India-Pakistan Triad,https://thediplomat.com/2024/08/nuclear-shadows-over-south-asia-strategic-instabilities-in-the-china-india-pakistan-triad/,"Recent attention to nuclear dangers has been largely devoted to expanding Chinese forces, Russian nuclear threats, and the growing momentum toward a comprehensive nuclear buildup in the United States. At the same time, there is a similar but largely unseen dynamic unfolding on the Asian Subcontinent – one that emulates the great power conundrum and should be more acutely observed. The China-India-Pakistan triad raises strategic risks and instabilities, posing a perhaps more concerning threat to nuclear non-use than the ongoing competition between China, Russia, and the United States.
Long considered the most likely theater for nuclear use, the same precarities, tensions, and territorial disputes that defined the three-way relationship between India, China, and Pakistan decades ago continue to shape their interactions. A quarter-century after the nuclearization of the Asian Subcontinent, a three-sided combination of evolving nuclear postures, military-technological modernizations, and strategic competition now compound these drivers of instability and are bringing the region closer to a nuclear crisis.
Indeed, the region has seen two dangerously close calls in just five years. The 2019 Pulwama-Balakot crisis brought India and Pakistan into direct military confrontation, while the 2022 BrahMos cruise missile incident marked the first time in history that a nuclear-capable cruise missile of one nuclear-armed state struck another. Both incidents deescalated not because of prudent decision-making but because both sides happened upon off ramps that allowed them to construct a domestic narrative of victory around their exit from the crises.
Perhaps the most dangerous dynamics between India and Pakistan are a shared overconfidence in their own ability to control escalation and a surety that the other will refrain from escalating a small-scale conventional conflict to the nuclear level. When both sides have internalized the belief that the other is committed to demonstrating restraint, both are more likely to see brinkmanship as a strategy for victory. The next time India and Pakistan find themselves amid an unfolding crisis, the conditions for de-escalation may not be present, and there may be no off ramps to be had.
What’s more, India simultaneously must manage a precarious border relationship with China. Recurrent skirmishes along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) have turned deadly in the past, and although a pattern of dialogue follows these skirmishes, the potential for future flashpoints escalating to new military heights remains high as each side increasingly militarizes its border policies.
As the overall tenor of Sino-Indian relations grows more tense amid competing foreign policies, they will need to manage better military relations and interactions along the LAC. The same can be said of the contested border areas of Kashmir along the Line of Control with Pakistan.
But long-standing rivalries and the insecurities they engender are not easily overcome, and despite a pressing need for engagement on risk reduction to prevent the next territorial dispute from erupting into nuclear use, neither India, China, nor Pakistan has shown such interest.
Rather, each has justified its nuclear modernizations in part by the threat perceptions generated by their neighbors’ nuclear maneuvers. India is responding to China’s strategic buildup and regional ambitions, while Pakistan’s embrace of tactical warfighting capabilities is in response to India’s emphasis on counterforce and strategic defenses.
China’s history of military cooperation with Islamabad adds to India’s insecurity as it faces seemingly intractable border disputes with its major neighbors. China and Pakistan share a long-standing strategic partnership and common interest in countering India’s regional dominance. The two cooperate in the military domain and maintain WMD proliferation networks that were discovered to be active as recently as March 2024.
For more than two decades, India and Pakistan have competed to improve the survivability of their nuclear forces and match one another at lower levels of escalation. For India, this has meant a commitment to maturing its ballistic missile submarine fleet, developing multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), exploring options for expanded missile defense, and prioritizing its Agni family of mobile missiles. Pakistan, in addition to expanding its strategic forces and hardening its command and control, has also built out a suite of lower threshold nuclear capabilities designed to be fitted with tactical nuclear warheads intended for the battlefield. With India likewise developing dual-capable cruise missile and battlefield nuclear capabilities, the chances for lower-level nuclear conflict are growing on the Subcontinent.
China’s nuclear modernization and expansion, meanwhile, are ostensibly geared toward the United States. The majority of Chinese nuclear-capable missiles, however, cannot reach the U.S. mainland but could easily strike Indian population centers. Beijing nonetheless has had to acknowledge an evolution in the Sino-Indian strategic relationship. Amid intensifying geostrategic competition, India has improved the range of its strategic missiles to cover all of mainland China.
New Delhi is also restructuring its ballistic missile forces into the Integrated Rocket Force, managing both nuclear-capable and conventional ballistic and cruise missiles. The entanglement of conventional and nuclear capabilities will introduce new ambiguities into Sino-Indian deterrence. India’s pursuit of MIRVs also implicates China in addition to Pakistan, as a MIRV-capable force could threaten to negate any perceived Chinese advantage in missile defense and could reinforce the risk of escalation at the conventional level if Chinese and Indian strategists begin concluding that a relative strategic balance has been reached.
Thus, despite China’s purported focus on competition with the United States, India’s overt fixation on deterrence vis-à-vis China is bringing the two into a more precarious nuclear relationship than they have ever known.
South Asia is the only place in the world where three nuclear-armed nations sit in such proximity and are bound by violently contested borders. The fuse in South Asia may be shorter than at any time in recent memory, and yet the China-India-Pakistan triad continues to receive inadequate attention outside the region. Given the escalating strategic risks in the triad, several measures can enhance stability and reduce the likelihood of nuclear conflict.
First, India and Pakistan should update the 1988 Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack Against Nuclear Installations and Facilities to reflect contemporary technological advancements. This modernization should include clearer definitions of nuclear-related targets and expanded mechanisms for verification and compliance.
Additionally, the existing notification regime, which currently covers ballistic missile tests, should be extended to include theater cruise missile tests. Moreover, the regime’s envelope could be expanded to include not only the test firing of missile capabilities, but also notifications of other development activities such as static tests. Including such tests in the notification regime would enhance transparency and build confidence between the two nations at a time when trust is at a premium. Ideally, these arrangements should be extended to China, although Beijing may be initially unwilling to engage.
Second, India and China, as well as India and Pakistan, should pursue cooperative border management efforts, including demilitarizing contested borders, enlarging buffer zones, and withdrawing forces from the uninhabitable Siachen Glacier. Enhanced deconfliction channels and regular border management meetings can help manage and deescalate potential conflicts.
Furthermore, India, China, and Pakistan should collaborate on counterterrorism efforts to stymie attacks by non-state groups that could plunge the region into a crisis. Specifically, Pakistan should realize that its tolerance of anti-Indian terrorism only serves to make Pakistan less secure by inflaming Indian threat perceptions. Joint counterterrorism operations and associated intelligence sharing can contribute to reducing the threat posed by non-state groups, improving the tangible security of the region while simultaneously opening up greater space for cooperation on other issues.
Third, India, China, and Pakistan should prioritize the establishment of a trilateral Nuclear Risk Reduction Center (NRRC) to facilitate real-time communication during crises and enhance mutual understanding. A South Asia NRRC could help manage and mitigate the risks associated with misinterpretations, low-level conflict or subconventional skirmishes, and accidental missile launches, and would furthermore contribute to managing threat perceptions between the three.
Initiating a formal nuclear dialogue between India and China is also imperative. Mechanisms that manage nuclear and broader military competition amid the backdrop of strategic competition would be to the benefit of all parties. Such a mechanism should promote the discussion of nuclear postures, doctrines, and intentions. This dialogue would help clarify mutual perceptions, reduce the risk of miscalculations, and foster transparency in nuclear policies.
Premeditated nuclear attacks remain improbable triggers for a nuclear conflict on the Subcontinent, but the combination of expanding nuclear arsenals, interest in nuclear warfighting postures, simmering territorial disputes, and the continued reach of extremist groups leaves the region prone to sudden and inadvertent escalation. There is a pressing need for the United States and the international community to extend their diplomacy beyond the primary concerns of China and Russia and to observe and address the fragile security dynamics in South Asia.
Regrettably, South Asia’s nuclear dynamics remain under the shadow of escalating great power nuclear competition, but overlooking the instabilities among India, China, and Pakistan risks neglecting a fuse that could ignite regional and global catastrophe. As global attention often focuses elsewhere, vigilance and proactive engagement are essential to prevent the China-India-Pakistan triad from becoming a crucible of nuclear conflict.

Securing America’s Critical Minerals: A Policy Priority Conundrum,https://thediplomat.com/2024/08/securing-americas-critical-minerals-a-policy-priority-conundrum/,"“When I think about climate change, I think jobs,” U.S. President Joe Biden has repeatedly said. His landmark Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) embodies this idea, tying together U.S. climate and industrial policies with a vast array of subsidies aimed at sparking a green manufacturing boom. Built into these subsidies are mechanisms to secure U.S. supply chains and to shore up domestic manufacturing, which has atrophied in recent decades, strategic priorities that Biden inherited from his predecessor, Donald Trump.
Although recent U.S. policymaking has exhibited a hyperfocus on supply chain security for semiconductors and other dual-use items, an area of equal – arguably greater – strategic significance is the supply of critical minerals, the building blocks of most advanced technologies, including those with military application.
Ever-present, but often unspoken, in Washington’s supply chain strategy is China. From the nickel used in fighter jet engines to the rare earth elements used in wind turbines, China’s dominance in the global supply of critical minerals presents a potential chokehold on U.S. industry. China accounts for 77 percent of the world’s refined cobalt, 65 percent of its chemical lithium, and 91 percent of its battery-grade graphite. All three minerals are essential for the production of lithium-ion batteries, a key component in the green transition.
China’s market dominance exists in part due to generous state subsidies. Analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies calculates a “conservative estimate” of $230 billion in electric vehicle (EV) subsidies for the period 2009-2023. Increasingly, green technologies are fundamental to Xi Jinping’s “high quality growth” strategy, which aims to spur high-productivity advanced manufacturing sectors amid a broader slump in the Chinese economy.
Critical minerals sit at the intersection of three policy objectives for the United States. First, policymakers must ensure national security. If China were to cut off supply of critical minerals, it could devastate the U.S. economy, with particular impacts for the manufacture of advanced technologies, including those with military application. This is why the U.S. is seeking to decouple and reshore supply chains. Second, policymakers are seeking to revive the U.S. manufacturing sector and catalyze job creation by embracing fast-growing green industries, in particular the EV sector. Third, policymakers are addressing the climate crisis by accelerating the rollout of green technologies.
Although these three policy objectives are not directly in competition with one another, their implementation can lead to contradictory, even dysfunctional, outcomes.
The IRA, alongside the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the CHIPS and Science Act, ostensibly aims to address these three policy objectives in one fell swoop. A fundamental challenge is that U.S. industry, and that of Western allies more broadly, has struggled to compete with the low prices of Chinese producers, and the price gap is only getting wider. In theory, a balanced diet of policies that would correct the market distortions of Chinese subsidies (and the resultant oversupply that has flooded international markets) would be the ideal solution to safeguard U.S. green technology growth, but this is difficult. To de-risk supply chains and build up capacity – whether this be domestic or “friendshored” – requires a step incompatible with a genuine commitment to a global green transition: the exclusion, at least to some degree, of cheap Chinese green technologies from U.S. markets.
China is equally weaponizing supply chains, and nowhere is this clearer than in the area of critical minerals. Beijing has proved willing to employ export controls in pursuit of geopolitical ends, most notably following a 2010 diplomatic incident with Japan over the contested Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. Most recently in 2023, Chinese restrictions on gallium and germanium exports, as well as greater export controls on high-grade graphite, have rung alarm bells.
The Three Competing Policy Imperatives
The contradictions between the competing objectives of security, jobs and growth, and climate, and the resulting policy pathologies, play out in the detail of policy. The IRA’s headline green policy is the landmark $7,500 EV consumer tax credit (known as “30D”). To qualify, EVs must be manufactured in North America, and the batteries must be 60 percent produced in the United States or countries with which the U.S. has free trade agreements.
Security: The tip of the spear for U.S. security incentives in the IRA are the requirements relating to “foreign entities of concern” (FEOCs). FEOCs are those entities – usually companies – based in or otherwise controlled by “covered nations”: China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran. EVs with batteries or battery components manufactured by an FEOC are excluded from the 30D tax credit. From 2025, the requirements will expand to include critical minerals produced by an FEOC, effectively excluding China from any part of the EV supply chain. Separately, the Defense Production Act was invoked by both Trump and Biden to include rare earth elements and battery minerals, opening up a range of policy levers for increasing domestic production in the name of national security.
Jobs and growth: The 30D tax credit also includes a sourcing requirement that eligible EVs are manufactured in North America and that the batteries must be at least 60 percent produced in the U.S. or partner countries with which the U.S. has free trade agreements, ensuring U.S. manufacturers are likely to benefit at all stages of the supply chain. Somewhat confusingly, however, the investment tax credit (under Section 48C) and the production tax credit (under Section 45X) for renewables, batteries, and critical minerals do not include the same FEOC restrictions. If Chinese companies were to invest, this disconnect leaves open the scenario that batteries subsidized by Section 48C or 45X couldn’t be used in EVs seeking to qualify for the tax credit under Section 30D.
Green transition: Policymakers have also been forced to carve out exemptions to these requirements, lest they throttle mid- to down-stream production. Graphite, over 90 percent of which is produced in China, is excluded from the FEOC requirements of 30D in recognition of the limited domestic capacity. Indeed, U.S. domestic graphite production was non-existent until only February this year, when Syrah Resources commenced production at a facility in Louisiana. Likewise, tariffs on graphite and permanent magnets for EVs will not be implemented until 2026, indicating continued dependency on China.
Yet, in a nod to competition with China over its burgeoning EV industry, Chinese EVs will this year face a 100 percent tariff, with tariffs on solar cells and EV lithium-ion batteries rising to 50 percent and 25 percent, respectively, in an attempt to insulate U.S. industry from a “China Shock 2.0.”
These are just some examples of an increasingly complex regulatory web in which competing and overlapping policy tools are inadvertently hampering U.S. grand strategy. Such dysfunctionality is also doing harm to business where confidence is everything.
In the particular area of critical minerals, a balance must be struck in between the green transition and protectionist decoupling. Tariffs and exclusion from subsidies serve primarily to exclude China from supply chains, going beyond simply leveling the playing field. Although the Biden administration has carefully considered climate goals, we should be honest that protectionism and national security have remained priorities.
What’s in a Name?
The blurring of policy priorities is partly a definitional issue. The term “critical minerals” disguises the question: critical for what? Critical minerals required for sustaining armed conflict are overlapping but distinct from those required for the green transition. Generally defined by their economic significance and their risk of supply chain disruption, lists of critical minerals vary in length and composition across jurisdictions.
This broad definition can lead to somewhat inconsistent categorization. Take nickel and rare earth metals, both categorized as critical minerals. For the former, Indonesia is the leading producer; China produces 28 percent of global processed supply. For the latter, China produces 92 percent of global refined supply. The former is used primarily in lithium-ion batteries, as well as superalloys with military and aviation applications. The latter is used in wind turbines, lasers, electronics, and guidance systems. It is challenging to produce a coherent geopolitical strategy for a sector that encompasses such a range of characteristics.
If the effectiveness of Chinese export restrictions on critical minerals is likely to be limited, what else is driving U.S. policy? We have two suggestions. First, U.S. policymakers fear a conflict scenario with China in which the IRA and other policies have failed to build up sufficient domestic capacity, and U.S. military industrial capacity is left crippled by an embargo. Amid rising concerns over Xi Jinping’s intentions for Taiwan and bullish Chinese behavior in the contested waters of the South China Sea, a conflict scenario appears ever more real. However, as aforementioned, critical minerals for a conflict don’t necessarily reflect the minerals essential for the green transition.
Instead, perhaps this is an example of what Graham Allison called the “Thucydides Trap.” The term refers to the structural stresses at play when a hegemon is challenged by a rising power. A sense of insecurity felt by the ruling power pushes it to behave in ways that escalate tensions with the rising power. China’s dominance in critical minerals and green technology is a significant issue, but we should recognize that U.S. grand strategy is also about addressing the broader symbolism of industrial strength in today’s great power rivalry.
A Change of Guard?
A tight presidential race in the United States makes it difficult to draw long-term predictions over policy direction in the area of critical minerals. A proper understanding of the three objectives of the IRA and other legislation provides some insight into the possible fate of these policies should Vice President Kamala Harris lose.
Trump has repeatedly called climate change a “hoax,” and the green transition is not an area he would be likely to prioritize. Nevertheless, the securitization of critical mineral supply chains has been a unique point of continuity between Trump and Biden. Indeed, the IRA can be understood as a soft-spoken continuation of Trump’s “America First” protectionism. We can expect such efforts to be turned back up to eleven if Trump returns to the White House; he recently mooted a 60 percent blanket tariff on Chinese goods.
An instinct for destruction of his predecessor’s policy innovations might blind Trump to the synergies between his platform and various Biden-era policies. Nonetheless, the outsized share of green tech investment received by GOP districts provides a major incentive for a Republican Congress to support the IRA, or at least elements of it. During an attempt to repeal parts of the IRA in 2023, the Republican-controlled House Ways and Means Committee spared a tax credit for producing batteries and components. Indeed, given bipartisan support for mining subsidies, a Trump administration might well focus on expanding FEOC regulations and curbing EV credits.
Some remain hopeful that green industry has reached a tipping point where growth continues without government support. We must hope this is true. The world cannot afford to slow the green transition, nor can we afford an escalation with China; getting critical minerals wrong would be disastrous for both scenarios.
