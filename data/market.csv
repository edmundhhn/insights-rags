"Down 79%, This Growth Stock Could Double in the Housing Rebound",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/08/11/down-79-this-growth-stock-could-double-in-the-hous/,"A recovery in the housing market could help revive the real estate industry.
It's been a nerve-wracking August for investors.
After the Federal Reserve closed July by maintaining the benchmark Fed funds rate at 5.25% to 5.5%, where it's been for over a year, investors have been clamoring for a do-over.
The S&P 500 plunged 6% over the first three trading days of August as a raft of downbeat economic data convinced investors that the economy was weakening faster than expected and the Fed had erred in not lowering rates.
Stocks plunged on Monday as a surprise interest rate hike in Japan led to the unwind of a global ""carry trade"" in which investors had borrowed low-interest yen to invest in risky assets in the U.S. like the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks.
As a result of the sharp three-day sell-off, economists now expect the Fed to cut rates by 50 basis points in its September meeting and at least another 50 basis points before the year's over.
The economy is likely to remain uncertain, but one thing is clear. Lower interest rates will help to revive a struggling housing market, breathing new life into stocks that depend on real estate transactions.
That industry has been hit hard by the slowdown in the housing market, but a turnaround could be near. One stock that could soar in the recovery is Compass (COMP -1.84%), the nation's No. 1 real estate brokerage by sales volume.

Compass went public in the spring of 2021 when the real estate market was booming, and mortgage rates were around 3%. However, that boom did not last long, and by the time 2022 rolled around, revenue was sliding, and the stock was flailing.
With the housing market remaining on ice, Compass has focused on realigning its cost structure, investing in technology, and growing its base of agents, which has helped drive revenue higher even in a challenging market.
Revenue increased 14% to $1.7 billion in the second quarter, and Compass's number of principal agents rose 24% to nearly 17,000 as it's luring new agents with an attractive technology platform and a steady marketing push. After two years of declines in total transactions, the business has returned to growth, a sign that the industry is starting to turn around.
Compass is also targeting positive free cash flow this year and is making progress in profitability as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) jumped from $30.1 million to $77.4 million in the seasonally strong second quarter.
The real estate brokerage industry is in flux after a lawsuit against the National Association of Realtors forced brokerages to amend their business model with more disclosures and information that makes it clear that traditional 3% commissions are negotiable. As a part of the settlement agreement, Compass agreed to pay $57.5 million.
Compass has also assuaged concerns that the agreement would dramatically change the industry, noting in May that in the initial weeks after the settlement, 99% of new listings included offers to pay the buyers agent, and 96% included commission offers of 2% or more. Compass believes the settlement will have little impact on professional full-time agents.
The housing market will probably never return to the heady early days of the pandemic when Americans in cities were plucking up second homes and suburban plots with yards, and mortgage rates fell to less than 3%.
However, there is substantial pent-up demand from homebuyers looking for falling rates to effectively lower prices by bringing down monthly payments and from potential home sellers who may not want to give up their low mortgage rates when current rates are so high.
In June, existing home sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.89 million, down from a peak of 6.6 million in 2021, a decline of 41%. Reversing that loss would mean a surge in existing home sales of 70%.
Compass doesn't need that to happen, but even getting back to pre-pandemic levels would mean a 50% increase from current existing home sales, and that should make a significant difference on the bottom line. CEO Robert Reffkin told investors this spring, ""We believe when rates come down it will create a massive surge in transactions,"" and he predicted lower rates would mean hundreds of millions in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, assuming normalized annual home sales of 5.4 million-5.6 million homes.
The business is already moving in the right direction, with revenue up double digits, and growth is likely to accelerate substantially as mortgage rates come down and the housing market picks up again.
Compass stock has already more than doubled from its low last November, trending with hopes of a recovery in the housing market and stabilization in its own business. Down 79%, Compass doesn't have to recoup those losses to be a winner. The stock could double by only retracing a quarter of those losses.
If the Fed cooperates and the housing market shows signs of life, a double for the real estate brokerage stock from here certainly seems within reach.

"Down 54%, Is It Time to Buy the Dip on This Growth Stock?",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/08/11/down-54-is-it-time-to-buy-the-dip-on-this-growth-s/,"GXO Logistics slipped on its earnings report. Is it a buying opportunity?
GXO Logistics (GXO -1.16%) is the world's largest pure-play contract-logistics company.
The company was spun off from XPO in 2021 under the logic that as separate companies, each one could make acquisitions in its own interest and allocate capital in the way that best suited it.
GXO has executed on that vision, making three acquisitions in three years and growing organically as well. However, a sluggish economy has presented challenges for the company. Inventory gluts following the pandemic meant that many of its customers were focused on paring down inventory over the last year, and the industrial economy has been slow as well.
As a result, GXO shares have traded mostly sideways in the last few years, and the stock was hovering just above a 52-week low following its recent second-quarter earnings report. It's now down 54% from its post-spinoff peak in the heady stock market of 2021.
Should investors take advantage of the recent sell-off? Let's take a closer look at where GXO stands after the latest report.
Image source: GXO.
Shares of GXO fell 5% after the earnings report came out on Tuesday. Results were mostly in line with estimates, but organic revenue growth of 2% was at the bottom end of the company's full-year guidance, and earnings took a hit due to headwinds in the macro-level economy.
Reported revenue jumped 19% to $2.8 billion in the quarter due primarily to its acquisition of Wincanton earlier in Q2, which bolstered the company's presence in the U.K., including in key verticals like aerospace and defense, and added more than 200 facilities to GXO's base.
Costs associated with integrating Wincanton weighed on margins as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) slipped from $190 million to $187 million, and adjusted earnings per share fell from $0.70 to $0.55.
In a sign that momentum was picking up, GXO said that its sales pipeline, or backlog, increased to a 12-month high of $2.3 billion. It signed $270 million worth of new business wins in annualized revenue in the quarter.
The logistics industry has evolved from traditional picking and packing to become highly automated, and GXO has invested heavily in technology, seeing it as an important advantage.
In an interview with the Motley Fool, GXO Chief Strategy Officer Kristine Kubacki stressed the importance of technology, saying,
We don't have a commercial discussion with a customer that doesn't include some sort of automation, and I think we've been doing it the longest. I think we do it the best, and I think that's the real differentiator with our customers.
GXO recently introduced a humanoid robot for its warehouse as part of a pilot program. Working with Apptronik, the company has deployed a general industrial humanoid robot that is 5'8"" tall, can carry 55 pounds, and runs on swappable batteries. It can handle tasks like picking and packing items.
Artificial intelligence is also becoming a source of differentiation for GXO, as it's using new AI technology to optimize picking, manage inventory flow, and predict inventory replenishment.
GXO management told investors on the earnings call that inventory trends were starting to improve after the cycle bottomed in last year's Q4, and it expected to see more of a normal holiday season this year. The company should also benefit from easier comparisons heading into the second half of the year.
Meanwhile, GXO remains focused on its 2027 targets, which call for 8% to 12% organic revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2021 to 2027, reaching $17 billion in revenue, 17% adjusted EBITDA CAGR to $1.6 billion, and cumulative free cash flow generated during that time of $2 billion.
GXO currently has an enterprise value of $10.6 billion, meaning it trades at roughly six times 2027 EBITDA.
It will take time for the momentum in the business to reaccelerate, but falling interest rates should give the economy a boost, and GXO's technological advantage and global reach should help it continue to attract new customers and grow existing relationships.
For patient investors, the stock looks like a good buy at current levels as the valuation looks attractive, and its organic growth rate will eventually accelerate.

"Down Between 12% and 24% From Their 52-Week Highs, 3 Magnificent Dow Dividend Stocks to Buy Now",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/08/11/down-big-from-highs-buy-dow-dividend-stocks/,"Buying excellent companies when they are out of favor can be a winning strategy over the long term.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is known for containing 30 industry-leading components from a variety of stock market sectors. But even Dow stocks can endure steep sell-offs.
Dow components Salesforce (CRM 1.37%), Chevron (CVX 0.35%), and Home Depot (HD 0.09%) are down between 12% and 24% from their 52-week highs and are all down year-to-date despite gains in the broader indexes like the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite.
Here's why all three dividend stocks stand out as solid buys for patient investors.
Image source: Getty Images.
It may have surprised investors when Salesforce -- a growth stock -- was added to Dow in August 2020. At the time, Salesforce was inconsistently profitable and didn't pay a dividend. But Salesforce has matured a lot as a company in recent years. Today, it is no longer focused purely on revenue and reinvesting everything back into the business. The company is highly profitable, announced its first-ever quarterly dividend earlier this year, and is buying back a ton of its stock.
Companies like Salesforce reward employees with stock-based compensation, which can dilute existing shareholders. Over the last decade, Salesforce's outstanding share count has increased by 54%. However, it has bought back stock in recent years to help offset stock-based compensation and has reduced its share count by 1% over the last three years.
Salesforce has taken a page from Microsoft's playbook. Microsoft paid a record $10.7 billion in stock-based compensation over the last 12 months -- up 123% in five years, but has managed to reduce its outstanding share count by 2.6% over that time thanks to buybacks. It takes a highly profitable business to execute this kind of strategy. But if done right, it can help companies recruit and retain top talent without diluting shareholders.
Salesforce stands out as one of the most balanced tech stocks out there. The dividend yield is just 0.7% -- but again the company just began paying dividends. The forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is just 24.5 -- suggesting Salesforce is fairly inexpensive compared to its historical valuation. The biggest red flag with Salesforce is that growth has slowed, and the company hasn't done a great job monetizing artificial intelligence. However, it would be a mistake to overlook Salesforce's industry-leading position and runway for long-term growth in enterprise software.
There are plenty of other tech stocks that are in favor -- but many of them command expensive price tags. Salesforce stands out as a good buy if you are looking for a more reasonable valuation and a company that isn't going full throttle on growth, but rather is focused more on profitably and returning capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.
Despite strong results, Chevron is hovering around a 52-week low. Oil prices are partially to blame.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices -- the U.S. benchmark -- have spent most of the year above $75 per barrel. However, oil prices have been falling recently, and WTI prices are now under that mark.

Chevron's closest peer -- ExxonMobil -- is up nicely on the year and is within just 5% or so from an all-time high. Although they are similar businesses, ExxonMobil and Chevron do have some distinct differences, especially regarding their merger and acquisition activity.
While Exxon completed its acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources in May, Chevron has yet to make progress on its acquisition of Hess. It's been 10 months since Chevron first made the announcement to buy the exploration and production company for $53 billion, but a variety of roadblocks stand in its way.
Although Chevron isn't as spotless as Exxon right now, it stands out as a particularly compelling buy. Consistent dividend raises paired with a sell-off in the stock have pushed Chevron's yield up to 4.6%. Over the last two years, Chevron returned $50 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks -- illustrating the extent of its outsize earnings.
Chevron can fund its operations and dividend even when oil is $50 per barrel, giving it a nice margin of error relative to current oil prices. Add it all up, and Chevron is a quality dividend stock to buy now.
Home Depot is roughly flat on the year for a variety of arguably valid reasons. For starters, Home Depot's growth has ground to a halt. The company is sensitive to ebbs and flows in the broader economy. So far this earnings season, a variety of companies have indicated that consumers remain selective on spending, especially on discretionary goods.
Home Depot benefits from a strong economy and a hot housing market. Lower interest rates are excellent news for Home Depot because they mean cheaper borrowing costs, lower mortgage rates, and less expensive financing on home improvement projects. Unfortunately, that is not the environment we are in today.
However, there are degrees to cyclical companies. For example, some companies are truly boom or bust based on economic factors or commodity prices. But Home Depot is more so boom or stagnate.
Over the last decade, Home Depot's sales have nearly doubled, and diluted earnings per share have more than tripled. But over the last couple of years, you can see that Home Depot's earnings and sales are slightly down.

HD Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
While Home Depot's performance could continue to disappoint in the near term, there's no reason to believe anything has changed about the underlying investment thesis. Earlier this year, Home Depot made a massive $18 billion acquisition because it had the dry powder needed to invest no matter the market cycle. It's also worth understanding that Home Depot's dividend is affordable, seeing as the company's payout ratio is a healthy 57%.
With a P/E ratio of 23.2 and a yield of 2.5%, Home Depot is a balanced, industry-leading business worth buying now.
Salesforce, Chevron, and Home Depot may operate in entirely different industries. But all three companies are similar in that they are undergoing slower growth or even negative growth (in the case of Home Depot).
Short-term-minded investors may quickly pass on all three companies, but long-term investors focus on where a company will be several years from now rather than where it is today. Salesforce, Chevron, and Home Depot show no signs of losing their industry-leading positions -- making all three stocks worth considering now.
Daniel Foelber has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Chevron, Home Depot, Microsoft, and Salesforce. The Motley Fool recommends the following options: long January 2026 $395 calls on Microsoft and short January 2026 $405 calls on Microsoft. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

"Is Now the Time to Buy the 2 Worst-Performing Stocks in the ""Magnificent Seven""?",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/08/11/is-now-the-time-to-buy-the-2-worst-performing-stoc/,"One of these stocks is a seemingly more promising investment than the other right now.
Big tech stocks are struggling lately as investors grow concerned about whether investments into artificial intelligence (AI) will pay off, and if valuations have simply become too high. Looming concerns about a recession are also a reason the markets seem to be coming under pressure.
Most of the stocks in the ""Magnificent Seven"" are underperforming the S&P 500 and its 9% gains this year. While shares of Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet are up by more than double digits this year, the others are lagging behind. The two worst-performing stocks in the Magnificent Seven are Microsoft (MSFT 0.83%) and Tesla (TSLA 0.58%).
Is now a good time to add these stocks to your portfolio?
Microsoft has been one of the big AI stocks to own in the past couple of years as it has invested billions into OpenAI and enhanced its Office suite with AI capabilities. And so expectations are high for the computer maker. While the company beat expectations in its most recent quarterly report, investors may have been looking for much more.
Sales for the period ending June 30 totaled $64.7 billion and were up 15% year over year. This came in slightly higher than the $64.4 billion that analysts were expecting. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.95 also came in slightly higher than the $2.93 in per-share profit that analysts were expecting.
While Microsoft has a stellar business and many opportunities to benefit from AI's growth, the bar is set high as it is one of the most valuable companies in the world and it trades at 34 times its trailing profits. For Microsoft to maintain this high valuation, it may need to do more than just beat earnings. Although its 7% gains aren't all that bad this year, for it to be performing at a high rate, it likely will need to generate much more growth. The big test may be how strong demand will be for its new AI-powered PCs, and whether that can serve as a catalyst for the business.
In the long run, however, Microsoft can still be an excellent stock to own given its vast growth opportunities in PCs, gaming, and cloud computing. The business is robust and while the valuation may seem a bit high, as the company grows in size, so too will its earnings, which will improve its valuation. If you're looking for a stock that you can buy and hold for decades, Microsoft can make a good addition to your portfolio today.
The worst-performing stock in the Magnificent Seven is Tesla. If not for a recent rally that it has been on, it would be down far more than just the 20% it currently is. That's how bad of a year it has been for the electric vehicle (EV) maker.
Consumer demand for Tesla's EVs hasn't been as strong as it has been in the past, and you can blame part of that on poor economic conditions, as well as an increase in competition. Tesla has reduced prices in response to other EV makers offering lower-priced products.
The problem is that Tesla needs higher prices in order to keep its margins elevated. Without high margins, that puts pressure on its bottom line. And the lower its bottom line is, the more expensive the stock is on a price-to-earnings basis. Typically, investors have been willing to pay a premium for Tesla's stock, but given that the business is struggling to generate growth these days, it's not as easy to justify doing so anymore.
Both the company's margins and growth rates have been trending in the wrong direction in recent quarters, which is creating a cause for alarm for investors.

TSLA Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts
Tesla isn't as clear of a buy as Amazon appears to be. It's trading at a higher earnings multiple (55) and growing competition could make it difficult for it to improve upon its financials anytime soon. With plenty of uncertainty in its future, investors may want to hold off on buying the stock right now.

Prediction: 1 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Semiconductor Stock That Could Be Worth $1 Trillion,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/08/11/prediction-1-top-artificial-intelligence-ai-semico/,"A couple of solid AI-related growth opportunities could help this chipmaker join the trillion-dollar market cap club in the future.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has turned out to be a solid growth driver for many semiconductor companies, and Broadcom (AVGO 1.73%) is one of them, as the chipmaker is gaining from the growing adoption of this technology across multiple applications ranging from data centers to enterprise networking to smartphones.
Though Broadcom stock has been in pullback mode of late, dropping 22% from the 52-week high it hit on June 18, a closer look at the company's prospects and its growth potential suggests that the downturn could be temporary. The chip giant currently has a market cap of $661 billion, and there is a good chance that it could join the $1 trillion market cap club in the future.
In this article, we will take a closer look at the reasons why Broadcom seems to be on its way to achieving that milestone.
Nvidia has become the dominant force in the market for AI data center graphics processing units (GPUs), but Broadcom has established a solid position for itself in a different niche of the AI chip market. JPMorgan points out that Broadcom is the leader in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which are custom chips designed for performing specific tasks.
Broadcom reportedly commands between 55% to 60% of this market, according to Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. The chipmaker has built a solid clientele for its custom AI chips, which include the likes of Alphabet and Meta Platforms. Even better, Broadcom recently added a third customer for its custom AI processors, which explains why the company has increased its revenue expectations from AI chips.
AI chips accounted for 15% of Broadcom's semiconductor revenue in fiscal 2023, a figure that's expected to grow to 35% in fiscal 2024. The chipmaker expects to generate more than $10 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024 from sales of its custom AI chips, which means that almost 20% of its forecast fiscal 2024 revenue of $51 billion will be from AI.
JPMorgan, however, sees more revenue upside for Broadcom in custom AI chips with an estimated revenue opportunity in the range of $20 billion to $30 billion. What's more, the investment bank adds that Broadcom's custom AI chip opportunity could increase at a compound annual growth rate of over 20% in the long run.
That won't be surprising as tech giants have been looking to reduce their reliance on Nvidia's expensive GPUs so that they can train and deploy AI models and applications in a more cost-effective manner. Recent chatter indicates that ChatGPT developer OpenAI could be in negotiations with Broadcom for the development of custom AI chips.
However, custom processors aren't the only big opportunity for Broadcom in the AI market. The chipmaker's networking business is also getting a big boost as AI data centers require high-speed connectivity to transfer huge amounts of data rapidly. On its June earnings conference call, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan pointed out, ""As AI data center clusters continue to deploy, our revenue mix has been shifting toward an increasing proportion of networking.""
Shipments of the company's ethernet switches doubled on a year-over-year basis. It won't be surprising to see Broadcom's networking business getting better in the long run as, according to market research firm Omdia, AI-specific network traffic is forecast to grow at a whopping annual rate of 120% through 2030.
As a result, AI data centers are likely to spend more money on switches to ensure faster connectivity. Market research firm Dell'Oro expects AI to double the market for data center switches to $80 billion over the next five years. So, Broadcom could be sitting on a bigger opportunity in the data center switching market thanks to AI.
Broadcom is expected to finish the current fiscal year with $4.75 per share in earnings, and as the chart below shows us, its bottom line could keep growing at a healthy pace over the next couple of years.

AVGO EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts
Analysts are expecting Broadcom to clock annual earnings growth of 18% over the next five years. Based on the company's estimated earnings of $4.75 per share for the current year, its bottom line could jump to $10.87 per share after five years. The stock is currently trading at 24 times forward earnings, which is a discount to the Nasdaq-100 index's forward earnings multiple of 28 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks).
Assuming it continues to trade at even 20 times forward earnings after five years, its stock price could jump to $217 based on the projected earnings estimate. That would be a 53% increase from current levels, which would be just about enough to send this AI stock into the trillion-dollar market cap club based on its current valuation of $661 billion.

Where Will Amazon Stock Be in 3 Years?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/08/11/where-will-amazon-stock-be-in-3-years/,"Can this tech conglomerate hold on to its lofty valuation as AI optimism fades?
With shares down almost 20% in the last 30 days, Amazon's (AMZN 0.69%) AI-powered rally is beginning to falter. There are also concerns that a potential economic slowdown could hurt its consumer-driven business model. Let's explore how these near-term challenges could affect the stock's performance over the next three years and beyond.
It is impossible to predict the future, but investors should pay attention to macroeconomic factors that could affect their thesis. For Amazon and other consumer-goods-focused companies, the main near-term threat could be a recession, which many economists see as more likely after the July unemployment rate (4.3%) came in higher than expected.
When people lose their jobs, they have less money to spend on online shopping, which leans toward discretionary items over necessities. However, the good news is that Amazon's customers still look strong.
Second-quarter revenue increased 10% year over year to $148 billion, driven by expansion in North American and international e-commerce.
Both segments are relatively mature, so investors shouldn't expect explosive growth in the future. However, Amazon has focused on juicing profitability through workforce reductions and supply chain efficiency, and these efforts are bearing fruit. Operating income increased 59% to $5.1 billion for North America, while the international segment jumped from a loss of around $900 million to a gain of around $300 million.
While Amazon's e-commerce business has transitioned into a stable cash cow, new segments will help power the next leg of long-term growth. Following the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022, generative artificial intelligence (AI)-related demand has boosted the company's cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS).
AWS focuses on the infrastructure side of the AI opportunity, offering clients pre-trained AI services like Amazon Rekognition (which helps with image recognition and video analysis) or Amazon Macie, designed to use machine learning to protect clients' sensitive data.
Amazon also boasts a foundational large language model (LLM) called Bedrock, which allows clients to create customized conversational algorithms in the same vein as ChatGPT, but trained on their own data.

Amazon's picks-and-shovels take on AI could shield it from some of the competition on the consumer-facing side of the opportunity. And the fact that these new AI offerings are integrated into the AWS platform could serve as an economic moat by making AWS a one-stop shop for all of a client's cloud-related needs. Segment revenue jumped 19% year over year to $26.3 billion, while operating income surged 72% to $9.3 billion.
While Amazon's e-commerce and cloud computing businesses are looking stronger than ever, the next 12 months could present some challenges. Data analytics company Statista gives the U.S. economy a 52% chance of entering a recession by May 2025.
Even if a downturn doesn't occur, cracks are beginning to form in the AI growth narrative as consumer-facing start-ups fail to justify their infrastructure spending with revenue and earnings. According to Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss, the industry is debating whether these companies will ever be able to monetize these algorithms, considering the huge amount of capital expenditure needed to train and run them.
With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 35, Amazon stock trades at a modest premium over the NASDAQ 100 estimate of 28. This might be a little high considering the near-term challenges it faces. Over the long term, Amazon is still a winner. However, investors may want to wait for a better price before taking a position in the stock.

Market Sell-Off: Is It Time to Buy the Dip on This Phenomenal Streaming Stock?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/08/11/market-sell-off-is-it-time-to-buy-the-dip-on-this/,"Investors might want to take advantage of the stock market's recent pessimism.
Investors have been hit with some turmoil in recent days. Soft U.S. economic data, an interest rate hike in Japan, and Berkshire Hathaway's aggressive selling have resulted in notable declines over the past week for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite index.
However, astute investors understand that volatility is par for the course when it comes to achieving solid long-term returns. In fact, the sell-off might present lucrative opportunities in otherwise fantastic companies, like this streaming pioneer whose shares are down 10% from their 2024 peak (as of Aug. 6).
Should investors buy the dip on this phenomenal stock?
Investors looking to gain exposure to Netflix (NFLX 0.57%), the leading pure-play streaming business, might want to take advantage of the market's pessimism. There are a few reasons to appreciate this company.
Let's start with Netflix's first-mover advantage. Its head start in the streaming race helped attract customers at a rapid pace, with outsized revenue growth. Netflix was winning over subscribers in spectacular fashion because it offered a superior user experience when compared to traditional cable TV.
Of course, the streaming industry is much more competitive now. But Netflix reigns supreme. As of June 30, it had 278 million members in over 190 countries. This has become a global media and entertainment powerhouse with scale benefits.
Admittedly, growth will slow, even though management estimates the total addressable market opportunity (that are not currently Netflix customers) to be at 500 million smart-TV households worldwide. In its most mature markets, the U.S. and Canada, Netflix historically has been able to successfully flex its pricing power.
Netflix's size means it makes plenty of revenue, to the tune of $36 billion in the last 12 months. This allows it to spend hefty amounts on producing and licensing content, while registering expanding profitability. The company expects to report an operating margin of 26% this year. That would be better than last year's 21% and 2022's 18%. Netflix is clearly showing benefits of its scalable business model, at a time when rivals struggle with bottom-line performance.
Because Netflix was spending so much money during the 2010s to acquire subscribers and develop its content offerings, critics never thought the business would generate positive free cash flow (FCF). Netflix proved the doubters wrong. The company brings in billions of dollars in FCF and uses some of it to buy back shares.
It's rare for investors to see such a dominant enterprise's shares go on sale. In May 2022, Netflix stock sold for a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15, which is unheard of. Besides general market weakness amid rising interest rates, investors were worried about Netflix's Q1 2022 subscriber losses. But with the benefit of hindsight, this turned out to be a wonderful buying opportunity.
Netflix stock isn't close to being that cheap today. It trades for a P/E ratio of 39. On the surface, this does not look compelling. It represents a 25% premium to the Nasdaq-100 index. However, it is much cheaper than the stock's trailing five- or 10-year average valuation multiples.
It's also worth pointing out that in the past five years, Netflix's earnings per share (EPS) have soared at a compound annual rate of 52%. According to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, EPS is projected to rise at an annualized pace of 32% between 2023 and 2026.
With the shares down 10% from their 2024 peak, it looks like a good time to take advantage of the dip and add Netflix to your portfolio.

Elon Musk Just Said Tesla Has a $200 Trillion Opportunity in Front of It. Here's What It Would Take to Get There.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/08/11/elon-musk-just-said-tesla-has-a-200-trillion-oppor/,"Tesla's next big opportunity has nothing to do with its cars.
Marketing is one of the hardest things to do in business. At its core, marketing is a form of storytelling. If brands fail to craft compelling stories, then it's hard to resonate with consumers.
One company that notably doesn't rely on hefty advertising, however, is Tesla (TSLA 0.58%). Despite intense competition, Tesla has one thing that none of its competitors do. And no, I'm not talking about more sophisticated technology or loads of intellectual property (IP).
I'm talking about the company's outspoken CEO, Elon Musk. Very few leaders in the business world command the same kind of presence as Musk. No matter the context, it seems that the world listens nearly every time Musk opens his mouth.
Recently, Musk posited the idea that Tesla is staring down a $200 trillion opportunity called Optimus. The best part? It has nothing to do with the company's core electric vehicle (EV) business.
Let's dig into Musk's remarks and explore how real the opportunity is.
Most people are familiar with Tesla because of the company's EVs. But what you may not know is that Tesla also has several ambitions in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI).
One of the company's biggest AI projects revolves around humanoid robotics, which it calls Optimus. Essentially, Tesla is using machine learning to train human-sized robots on how to perform basic tasks.
The vision is that Optimus bots will become handy enough to supplement the human workers in Tesla's factories.
Image source: Getty Images.
During Tesla's second-quarter earnings call, Musk doubled down on his bullish outlook for Optimus when he proclaimed, ""As I've said before, I think Optimus will be more valuable than everything else combined.""
In the video below, Musk explains his perspective on Optimus and its potential to be a $200 trillion business:
ELON: THE OPTIMUS NUMBERS ARE SO MIND-BLOWING THAT THEY DON'T LOOK REAL""The Optimus numbers, they're so mind-blowing that you're like, is this real? I actually think the market for humanoid robots is in excess of 10 billion units, more than the number of humans. Because... pic.twitter.com/EjyqHab4Zi

Although Musk's comments may inspire some excitement, there are some important caveats to review here.
First, Tesla is far from the only company pursuing humanoid robotics. One of Tesla's biggest competitors in the space is Figure AI, a start-up backed by Nvidia, Intel, and Microsoft.
According to its website, Figure AI envisions a future in which humanoid robots are fully integrated into society, playing a major role in logistics, warehouse labor, retail, and even elderly care. Figure AI estimates that disrupting manual labor at scale could be a $42 trillion addressable market.
Beyond Optimus and Figure AI, other major players in humanoid robotics include Boston Dynamics, 1X, and a litany of start-ups in China. Given this level of attention, it's not entirely surprising that Goldman Sachs outlines humanoid robotics as a $38 billion market just by next decade.
The second point investors need to realize is that the total addressable market for humanoid robotics is all over the place, ranging from tens of billions to hundreds of trillions. While a time line for Optimus' scale to 10 billion units wasn't revealed, I think having more humanoid robots than people on Earth is quite a bold idea.
However, investors shouldn't get too caught up with the specifics of the forecast. With commercialization of Optimus slotted for just two years away, investors may know sooner than later what demand starts to look like.
It's too early to tell if humanoid robots will be a success and if Optimus will be a leader in the space. But just like Tesla's other products, Musk has done a stellar job of marketing the opportunity around Optimus and getting investors excited about the road ahead.

Mark Zuckerberg Has a Bold Vision for Meta's Chatbot. Is the Stock a Buy Based on What We've Seen So Far?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/08/11/mark-zuckerberg-has-a-bold-vision-for-metas-chatbo/,"Artificial intelligence could enhance Meta's existing apps and create a new source of revenue for the business.
Meta Platforms (META 1.60%) has billions of active users across all of its platforms. Between WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger, it has a huge user base that it can test new products and services on. Its Threads platform grew to over 100 million users in less than five days after launching last year, largely due to it being incredibly easy for Instagram users to try it out.
The company looks to be leveraging its users once again to help it jump on the next big bandwagon: artificial intelligence (AI). CEO Mark Zuckerberg sees it as a huge opportunity, and while Meta may be a bit late to the game, it has some ambitious targets ahead. And if it achieves them, that could make an already hot stock even better.
Artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT has been publicly available since November 2022 and it has ignited a lot of excitement around AI and how it can transform how people do tasks and potentially even eliminate the need for certain jobs. There are reportedly 200 million monthly active users on ChatGPT. But Zuckerberg thinks Meta's AI can surpass that -- before the end of the year.
Meta recently released a new AI model, Llama 3.1, which it says performs better than the latest GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on multiple benchmarks. The model is open-source -- meaning anyone can see and update the code -- which could attract many developers and potentially help make the model better over time. The AI will be integrated within the company's applications and even virtual reality headsets, making it easy for Meta's vast user base to gain exposure to it and potentially become regular users.
Given the billions of users Meta's applications have, surpassing ChatGPT in number of users may not be all that difficult, even if the goal is for that to happen before the end of the year.
I wouldn't be surprised if Meta can get a lot of people to use its AI platform, especially if it's easily accessible within WhatsApp, Facebook, and other popular applications. The real test, however, will be how long people use it for, and whether it will lure them away from ChatGPT. While people may accidentally click a button to launch the Meta AI or just test it out to see what it does, and that will surely bump up the user count, for it to really be a significant game changer for the business, it will need to show that it's better than ChatGPT or that it can at least be a viable alternative. That could take a bit longer to prove.
If that happens and users do indeed see value in Meta's chatbot, the company could find ways to monetize the product. ChatGPT, for instance, offers a subscription service to a more advanced version of its chatbot. Microsoft's Copilot is available within its Office software for an additional subscription price as well.
Plus, if Meta's AI can enhance the user experience within its existing applications, leading to greater usage and more users overall, that could also draw in more advertising dollars.
Meta has already been growing at an impressive rate and an AI boost could generate even more bullishness around the stock. For the three-month period ending June 30, Meta's sales grew by 22% to $39 billion. And its net income rose by 73% to $13.5 billion. Not only did the average price per ad increase by 10% during the quarter, but the number of ad impressions across its family of apps also rose at a similar rate. The stock is up about 40% so far this year.
Meta's business has been doing well, but I would hold off on buying the stock until it can prove that its new AI assistant can truly be the success that Zuckerberg envisions. There are a lot of big tech companies launching their own chatbots and it may not be easy to lure users away from one onto another.
If Meta's AI does prove it can win over users, however, then it could make the tech stock a no-brainer buy as it could accelerate the company's already strong growth rate.

"Down 54%, Is It Time to Buy the Dip on This Growth Stock?",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/08/11/down-54-is-it-time-to-buy-the-dip-on-this-growth-s/,"GXO Logistics slipped on its earnings report. Is it a buying opportunity?
GXO Logistics (GXO -1.16%) is the world's largest pure-play contract-logistics company.
The company was spun off from XPO in 2021 under the logic that as separate companies, each one could make acquisitions in its own interest and allocate capital in the way that best suited it.
GXO has executed on that vision, making three acquisitions in three years and growing organically as well. However, a sluggish economy has presented challenges for the company. Inventory gluts following the pandemic meant that many of its customers were focused on paring down inventory over the last year, and the industrial economy has been slow as well.
As a result, GXO shares have traded mostly sideways in the last few years, and the stock was hovering just above a 52-week low following its recent second-quarter earnings report. It's now down 54% from its post-spinoff peak in the heady stock market of 2021.
Should investors take advantage of the recent sell-off? Let's take a closer look at where GXO stands after the latest report.
Image source: GXO.
Shares of GXO fell 5% after the earnings report came out on Tuesday. Results were mostly in line with estimates, but organic revenue growth of 2% was at the bottom end of the company's full-year guidance, and earnings took a hit due to headwinds in the macro-level economy.
Reported revenue jumped 19% to $2.8 billion in the quarter due primarily to its acquisition of Wincanton earlier in Q2, which bolstered the company's presence in the U.K., including in key verticals like aerospace and defense, and added more than 200 facilities to GXO's base.
Costs associated with integrating Wincanton weighed on margins as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) slipped from $190 million to $187 million, and adjusted earnings per share fell from $0.70 to $0.55.
In a sign that momentum was picking up, GXO said that its sales pipeline, or backlog, increased to a 12-month high of $2.3 billion. It signed $270 million worth of new business wins in annualized revenue in the quarter.
The logistics industry has evolved from traditional picking and packing to become highly automated, and GXO has invested heavily in technology, seeing it as an important advantage.
In an interview with the Motley Fool, GXO Chief Strategy Officer Kristine Kubacki stressed the importance of technology, saying,
We don't have a commercial discussion with a customer that doesn't include some sort of automation, and I think we've been doing it the longest. I think we do it the best, and I think that's the real differentiator with our customers.
GXO recently introduced a humanoid robot for its warehouse as part of a pilot program. Working with Apptronik, the company has deployed a general industrial humanoid robot that is 5'8"" tall, can carry 55 pounds, and runs on swappable batteries. It can handle tasks like picking and packing items.
Artificial intelligence is also becoming a source of differentiation for GXO, as it's using new AI technology to optimize picking, manage inventory flow, and predict inventory replenishment.
GXO management told investors on the earnings call that inventory trends were starting to improve after the cycle bottomed in last year's Q4, and it expected to see more of a normal holiday season this year. The company should also benefit from easier comparisons heading into the second half of the year.
Meanwhile, GXO remains focused on its 2027 targets, which call for 8% to 12% organic revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2021 to 2027, reaching $17 billion in revenue, 17% adjusted EBITDA CAGR to $1.6 billion, and cumulative free cash flow generated during that time of $2 billion.
GXO currently has an enterprise value of $10.6 billion, meaning it trades at roughly six times 2027 EBITDA.
It will take time for the momentum in the business to reaccelerate, but falling interest rates should give the economy a boost, and GXO's technological advantage and global reach should help it continue to attract new customers and grow existing relationships.
For patient investors, the stock looks like a good buy at current levels as the valuation looks attractive, and its organic growth rate will eventually accelerate.

Should Apple Acquire Peloton in 2024? 2 Things Investors Need to Know.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/08/11/apple-acquire-peloton-2024-2-things-investors-know/,"The tech titan would be Peloton's white knight.
To say that Peloton Interactive (PTON 0.34%) has been struggling mightily would be an understatement. After experiencing monster success during the depths of the pandemic, the business has hit a rough patch, with weak demand, falling sales, and ongoing net losses.
To solve these notable issues, it might make sense for Peloton to be acquired, which could potentially get it on a better financial path. And maybe that suitor should be Apple (AAPL 1.37%), the dominant consumer tech juggernaut.
Here are two things that investors should know about this speculative deal.
Apple sells incredibly popular hardware products, like the iPhone, iPad, and MacBooks, that are supported by its own proprietary software offerings. Peloton operates a similar playbook. However, Apple has found tremendous success. And it's insanely profitable, boosted by a powerful brand and proven pricing power, something Peloton so desperately wants to have.
To be clear, Apple already has a hand in the wellness space. The Apple Watch and Fitness+ app are its key offerings here. And CEO Tim Cook even went so far as to say that the company's biggest contribution to humanity ""will be about health."" You can easily argue that Peloton also feels the same way about its own business.
From a strategic perspective, buying Peloton could make sense. It would add to the over 2.2 billion active Apple devices out there in the world. Peloton users are probably also coming from higher-income households that Apple could cross-sell to. And Apple could collect more fitness data that could bolster its ambitions in the health sector.
There are interesting integration opportunities as well. If a consumer signs up and pays for Peloton equipment with an Apple Card, maybe a discount or other incentives will be offered. The Fitness+ and Peloton digital apps could be combined. And Apple Music could provide the tunes for Peloton's various workout classes.
In the most recent fiscal quarter (Q3 2024, ended June 29), Apple reported more than $21 billion in net income. And it currently has $52 billion of net cash on its balance sheet. Even if Peloton sold at a huge premium to its current market cap of $1.1 billion, Apple could easily afford the transaction.
Based on what I just outlined, the deal makes sense. Apple would be a worthy buyer that Peloton shareholders can support. However, it's also easy to believe that an acquisition isn't going to happen.
Despite being a gargantuan $3.2 trillion business, Apple's corporate strategy doesn't really center on executing huge acquisitions. In 2014, the company completed its biggest deal when it purchased Beats for $3 billion. The price tag for buying Peloton would probably be in the same neighborhood. It's anyone's guess if executives would be comfortable doing this, when they could continue using excess cash to buy back shares and pay dividends.
But I can understand why Apple shareholders would approve of such a deal. Even if it happened and it became a waste of capital, Cook and his team at least took a chance on something that seemed to make strategic sense. Apple could easily handle the financial loss in a worst-case scenario.
There's also the obvious fact that Peloton is tiny by comparison, as it brought in $2.7 billion in revenue in the last 12 months, versus the $386 billion Apple raked in during its trailing-12-month period. Peloton doesn't look like it can move the needle for the tech giant, even if its sales skyrocketed under Apple.
Apple wants to sell products that target the entire global population. Peloton doesn't fall into this category. While I'm not sure a deal will ever be on the table, the exercise business would certainly benefit more if it happened.

How Much Will Lockheed Martin Pay Out in Dividends This Year?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/08/11/how-much-will-lockheed-martin-pay-out-in-dividends/,"The defense company has increased its dividend for the last 21 years.
Investors often choose U.S. defense stocks because they are attached to relatively safe companies. The U.S. government is a reliable customer, and there's no shortage of geopolitical tensions driving increased demand for defense spending around the globe. Moreover, stocks like Lockheed Martin (LMT -0.01%) tend to pay growing dividends.
The chart below shows the stock's dividend-per-share, earnings-per-share, and free-cash-flow-per-share ratios so you can see just how well covered its dividend is.

LMT Free Cash Flow Per Share data by YCharts
That healthy coverage will continue in 2024. The defense company's currently quarterly dividend is $3.15 per share, and the dividend currently yields about 2.3%. The midpoint of management's earnings-per-share guidance for 2024 is $26.35, and the dividend per share in 2024 will be $12.60. This year's payout will be about $3.04 billion, and management expects $6 billion to $6.3 billion in free cash flow in 2024.
In other words, Lockheed Martin plans to pay slightly less than 50% of its earnings and cash flow in dividends. This payout ratio allows room for growth, particularly if Lockheed Martin can continue growing earnings and cash to follow historical norms.
That seems likely, although investors shouldn't be too quick to assume that the increased defense orders will translate into rapid earnings and cash-flow growth. As previously discussed by me, many defense companies, including Lockheed Martin, are struggling with margin expansion due to problematic fixed-price programs secured in less inflationary times.
As such, Lockheed Martin is likely to be a solid rather than spectacular dividend grower, which might suit many investors.

"Down Between 12% and 24% From Their 52-Week Highs, 3 Magnificent Dow Dividend Stocks to Buy Now",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/08/11/down-big-from-highs-buy-dow-dividend-stocks/,"Buying excellent companies when they are out of favor can be a winning strategy over the long term.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is known for containing 30 industry-leading components from a variety of stock market sectors. But even Dow stocks can endure steep sell-offs.
Dow components Salesforce (CRM 1.37%), Chevron (CVX 0.35%), and Home Depot (HD 0.09%) are down between 12% and 24% from their 52-week highs and are all down year-to-date despite gains in the broader indexes like the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite.
Here's why all three dividend stocks stand out as solid buys for patient investors.
Image source: Getty Images.
It may have surprised investors when Salesforce -- a growth stock -- was added to Dow in August 2020. At the time, Salesforce was inconsistently profitable and didn't pay a dividend. But Salesforce has matured a lot as a company in recent years. Today, it is no longer focused purely on revenue and reinvesting everything back into the business. The company is highly profitable, announced its first-ever quarterly dividend earlier this year, and is buying back a ton of its stock.
Companies like Salesforce reward employees with stock-based compensation, which can dilute existing shareholders. Over the last decade, Salesforce's outstanding share count has increased by 54%. However, it has bought back stock in recent years to help offset stock-based compensation and has reduced its share count by 1% over the last three years.
Salesforce has taken a page from Microsoft's playbook. Microsoft paid a record $10.7 billion in stock-based compensation over the last 12 months -- up 123% in five years, but has managed to reduce its outstanding share count by 2.6% over that time thanks to buybacks. It takes a highly profitable business to execute this kind of strategy. But if done right, it can help companies recruit and retain top talent without diluting shareholders.
Salesforce stands out as one of the most balanced tech stocks out there. The dividend yield is just 0.7% -- but again the company just began paying dividends. The forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is just 24.5 -- suggesting Salesforce is fairly inexpensive compared to its historical valuation. The biggest red flag with Salesforce is that growth has slowed, and the company hasn't done a great job monetizing artificial intelligence. However, it would be a mistake to overlook Salesforce's industry-leading position and runway for long-term growth in enterprise software.
There are plenty of other tech stocks that are in favor -- but many of them command expensive price tags. Salesforce stands out as a good buy if you are looking for a more reasonable valuation and a company that isn't going full throttle on growth, but rather is focused more on profitably and returning capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.
Despite strong results, Chevron is hovering around a 52-week low. Oil prices are partially to blame.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices -- the U.S. benchmark -- have spent most of the year above $75 per barrel. However, oil prices have been falling recently, and WTI prices are now under that mark.

Chevron's closest peer -- ExxonMobil -- is up nicely on the year and is within just 5% or so from an all-time high. Although they are similar businesses, ExxonMobil and Chevron do have some distinct differences, especially regarding their merger and acquisition activity.
While Exxon completed its acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources in May, Chevron has yet to make progress on its acquisition of Hess. It's been 10 months since Chevron first made the announcement to buy the exploration and production company for $53 billion, but a variety of roadblocks stand in its way.
Although Chevron isn't as spotless as Exxon right now, it stands out as a particularly compelling buy. Consistent dividend raises paired with a sell-off in the stock have pushed Chevron's yield up to 4.6%. Over the last two years, Chevron returned $50 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks -- illustrating the extent of its outsize earnings.
Chevron can fund its operations and dividend even when oil is $50 per barrel, giving it a nice margin of error relative to current oil prices. Add it all up, and Chevron is a quality dividend stock to buy now.
Home Depot is roughly flat on the year for a variety of arguably valid reasons. For starters, Home Depot's growth has ground to a halt. The company is sensitive to ebbs and flows in the broader economy. So far this earnings season, a variety of companies have indicated that consumers remain selective on spending, especially on discretionary goods.
Home Depot benefits from a strong economy and a hot housing market. Lower interest rates are excellent news for Home Depot because they mean cheaper borrowing costs, lower mortgage rates, and less expensive financing on home improvement projects. Unfortunately, that is not the environment we are in today.
However, there are degrees to cyclical companies. For example, some companies are truly boom or bust based on economic factors or commodity prices. But Home Depot is more so boom or stagnate.
Over the last decade, Home Depot's sales have nearly doubled, and diluted earnings per share have more than tripled. But over the last couple of years, you can see that Home Depot's earnings and sales are slightly down.

HD Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
While Home Depot's performance could continue to disappoint in the near term, there's no reason to believe anything has changed about the underlying investment thesis. Earlier this year, Home Depot made a massive $18 billion acquisition because it had the dry powder needed to invest no matter the market cycle. It's also worth understanding that Home Depot's dividend is affordable, seeing as the company's payout ratio is a healthy 57%.
With a P/E ratio of 23.2 and a yield of 2.5%, Home Depot is a balanced, industry-leading business worth buying now.
Salesforce, Chevron, and Home Depot may operate in entirely different industries. But all three companies are similar in that they are undergoing slower growth or even negative growth (in the case of Home Depot).
Short-term-minded investors may quickly pass on all three companies, but long-term investors focus on where a company will be several years from now rather than where it is today. Salesforce, Chevron, and Home Depot show no signs of losing their industry-leading positions -- making all three stocks worth considering now.
