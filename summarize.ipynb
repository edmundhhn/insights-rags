       "\"**China's Renewable Energy Targets Take Shape**\\n\\nIn a recent update, China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and National Energy Administration (NEA) have released new requirements for provinces to source energy from renewable generators in 2024 and 2025. This move is part of the country's renewable energy consumption guarantee mechanism, which aims to increase domestic renewable energy consumption.\\n\\nSix provinces have seen significant increases in their renewable energy consumption mandates between 2023 and 2024, with Heilongjiang experiencing the highest jump from 22.7% to 30.0%. Hainan, Henan, Jilin, Hunan, and Gansu also saw increases greater than 6 percentage points.\\n\\nChina is on track to meet its renewable energy consumption goals, with the mechanism serving its purpose in driving growth in renewable and non-hydro renewable consumption share. However, three provinces - Zhejiang, Yunnan, and Xinjiang - fell short of targets, but were more than made up for by the significant growth in other provinces.\\n\\nThe only potential cause for concern is the tentative mandates for 2025, which have not seen significant increases despite the overall trend of growth. This may signal that fossil fuel consumption is expected to rise in those four provinces over the next 18 months, or that these are conservative estimates that will be revised upwards when they become binding.\\n\\nOverall, China's renewable energy targets continue to evolve and improve, with the country taking steps towards meeting its goals of peaking emissions by 2030 and reaching carbon neutrality by 2060.\""

Mass lost one percentage point of pickup sales share year-over-year, while supermarkets lost more than double (2.1 percentage points). Pickup continues to remain the dominant receiving method for online grocery sales in the U.S. with a 45.5% share, down 1.1 percentage points year-over-year.\\r\\nThe share of supermarket customers who also shopped with mass during the quarter rose 3.7 percentage points, reaching more than 32% with roughly one in five doing so with\\xa0Walmart. This gain was fueled by increased dual usage within the middle two income groups ($50,000 to $99,000 annual household income and $100,000 - $199,000) while both the lowest ( less than $50,000) and highest-income ($200,000-plus) groups decreased cross-shopping year-over-year.\\r\\n\"Walmart’s reputation for low prices helped to attract households that wanted both the convenience of shopping online and ways to save money in this market,\" said David Bishop, partner at Brick Meets Click. \"The execution of its omnichannel strategy, plus the operational efficiencies aided by incredibly high order demand, has enabled\\xa0Walmart\\xa0to consistently deliver the type of experiences that customers expect and to lower its cost to serve online orders at the same time.\"\\r\\nThe analysis leverages data from the monthly Brick Meets Click/Mercatus grocery shopping survey, an independent research initiative conducted by Brick Meets Click since March 2020, and sponsored by Mercatus.\\r\\nOnline grocery sales rise in June fueled by delivery and ship-to-home   June was a strong month for online grocery sales in the United States, with sales increasing 8% year-over-year.

The retail giant has implemented a program called Zero Depack, which uses organics recycler Denali\\'s technology to separate expired food from its packaging material with 97% accuracy. This allows associates to spend less time dealing with recycling and more time serving customers.\\n\\nWith Zero Depack, store associates simply toss expired food items into a receptacle, and the Denali technology does the rest. The separated food can then be converted into biosolids for various farming applications, such as compost or food for livestock.\\n\\nWalmart sees this initiative as part of its broader commitment to sustainability. In 2017, the company launched Project Gigaton, an effort to reduce one billion metric tons of carbon dioxide from its global value chain by 2030. The Zero Depack program is just one example of Walmart\\'s efforts to make meaningful changes and improve operations.\\n\\n\"Walmart facilities have a part to play in operating more sustainably,\" said R.J. Zanes, VP of facility services for Walmart U.S. \"By making sustainable choices, we can increase efficiencies, reduce costs, and improve experiences for our associates and customers.\"\\n\\nThis new technology is a positive step forward for Walmart, and we\\'re excited to see the impact it will have on reducing food waste in their stores!']"
