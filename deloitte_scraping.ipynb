      "Small business insurance has been one of the most talked about areas of insurance over the past five years. While talk has been high, action has been low from most incumbent insurers. Small businesses are changing their business models (e.g., ghost kitchens, digitally enabled operations, etc.) to align with evolving consumer behaviors and heightened risk awareness caused by the pandemic. This report from Deloitte Global was developed from a global survey which found that the need has never been greater for insurers to invest and differentiate in the market for small-to-medium enterprise (SME) insurance.\n",
      "To help answer how insurers can explore the small business insurance market, Deloitte surveyed 5,300 SMEs from 14 countries to understand their views about insurance.\n",
      "The survey revealed six key findings:\n",
      "As the SME segment has so far been largely untapped in a meaningful way, we believe a significant opportunity exists for profitable growth through a targeted investment and sharpened focus on the segment.\n",

      "We surveyed global insurance companies to look at readiness, perceptions, technology and the impact IFRS 17 may have beyond 2023.\n",
      "Deloitte sponsored the Economist Impact to survey 360 insurance executives who are engaged in the implementation of IFRS 17. This research has produced new insights on the collective view of the insurance industry on IFRS 17.\n",
      "Additionally, we have published a statistical compendium that shares all of the data from the Economist Impact survey to enable you to go deeper into specific areas of interest.\n",
      "In this first report of the survey findings, the Economist Impact team has focused on the responses we collected from participants based in the European Union (EU) given the EU-endorsed version of IFRS 17 has a key difference compared with the text originally published by the International Accounting Standards Board. This difference is the addition of a voluntary exemption from one key requirement in IFRS 17 that many stakeholders in the EU endorsement process believed should not apply on a mandatory basis to a particular type of life insurance business commonly found in the EU.\n",
      "The highlights from the survey are that a large majority of EU-headquartered insurance groups will choose the voluntary adoption of the EU exemption. The overwhelming sentiment indicated that this choice is not expected to significantly dilute the benefit of the level playing field that IFRS 17 could deliver globally. Participants in the survey also noted their plan to provide disclosure on the use of the EU exemption.\n",
      "Download the report\n",
      "In this second article of a four-part series, the Economist Impact team focuses on the technology considerations of the survey. The effort expended on the technology needed for IFRS 17 compliance was often more than initially estimated, but the expected benefits also appear to be greater. As the survey revealed, a much more transparent and agile finance capability may now be possible because packaged software helps to capture new information and offers new analyses that were previously impossible.\n",
      "IFRS 17 programs were often reported to be more complex, to take longer than expected, to cost more than planned and to require more broadly skilled resources. And these results did not vary much for different business scenarios. Data capture and analysis was a recurring theme as insurers found that the requirement for additional data granularity and governance was a primary consideration as they integrated and tested packaged solutions. The need to build foundational capabilities to tackle these challenges has created new opportunities to better report and manage financial and operational information.\n",
      "Download the report\n",
      "In this third article of our four-part series, we report on the views from the participants in the 2022 Global IFRS 17 Insurance Survey on how they will use the new IFRS 17 financial language to communicate to investors. With the focus on building sub-ledgers, introducing new charts of accounts, preparing data, and updating actuarial models, it is also sometimes easy with IFRS 17 to lose sight of the numbers themselves, and the story they tell about the performance of the underlying business.\n",
      "Yet, IFRS 17 is fundamentally different and therefore difficult to compare against IFRS 4, the previous standard for insurance accounting, which was designed as a mere interim solution. “The numbers” are much more than just a new balance sheet and P&L with additional, detailed disclosures. The survey shows that two aspects really stand out in terms of understanding the new world of IFRS 17:\n",
      "Download the report\n",
      "What might the future look like as the implementation of the standard continues? In this final article of a four-part series, we report on the views from the participants of the 2022 Global IFRS 17 Insurance Survey on whether they agree that the benefits of adopting IFRS 17 will outweigh the expected costs. With the bulk of the implementation investments made, and with insurance accounting set to be transformed, what long-term benefits can insurers expect beyond compliance and how can these benefits be grasped?\n",
      "Nearly half of all survey participants say that improved technology has brought new capabilities – with the possibility of new opportunities and benefits emerging as a result of the changes made. The survey shows that many insurers have already entered the IFRS17 world, and are moving to reap these potential benefits:\n",

      "Under the sponsorship of Deloitte, the Economist Impact surveyed 360 insurance executives during May and June 2022 to gauge the final views of the global insurance industry on IFRS 17. This survey took place only a few months before the \"go-live\" date of IFRS 17 on 1 January 2023.\n",

      "The digital transformation of financial services organizations is extending into ecosystems, introducing new players and shifting traditional roles. The Institute of International Finance (IIF) and Deloitte have been working together, speaking with public and private institutions, to better understand how these new ecosystems are impacting the industry. These ecosystems are evolving into dynamic networks who create value through complex models of collaboration, competition, and innovation. We will look at this across several dimensions in a series of reports.\n",
      "In this report from the IIF and Deloitte we look at the impact of data policies and the importance of broadening the scope from Open Banking to Open Data, not just Open Finance.

      "Global megatrends are reshaping the landscape of the global wealth management industry and redefining investor needs. To stay ahead of this industry shift, investment management firms need to revisit their strategies with a greater emphasis on investor expectations and competitor analysis.\n",
      "To analyze how investment firms are planning to meet fast-changing investor expectations, Deloitte, in collaboration with ThoughtLab and other industry specialists, conducted a global survey of investors and investment providers and researched how the industry is evolving.  We look at the impact of megatrends including technology, regulatory & taxes, competition, demographics and economic.\n",
      "The findings highlighted the following:\n",
      "Win with modernization:The changing face of investors demands personalized solutions and a more inclusive advisor base. Investment firms must harness technology and data to understand these needs, find market niches, and tailor their offerings accordingly.\n",
      "Capitalize on client diversity:As investors become more diverse in age, location, gender, wealth level, and lifestyle, firms that leverage technology and data will have a competitive edge. This includes building a diverse advisor base to cater to the varied needs of clients.\n",
      "Redefine digital for investors:Embrace the next generation of digital services, leveraging digitally enabled functionality for tasks like account opening, transfers, and communication with advisors.\n",
      "Innovate to drive performance:Seamlessly blend high tech with high touch by using technology to enhance advisors' capabilities, automate mundane tasks, and deliver a superior client experience, firms can position themselves as digital leaders.\n",
      "Empower the future advisor:Technology is revolutionizing the role of financial advisors, enabling them to manage a larger client base and offer personalized, comprehensive advice by automating routine tasks.\n",
      "Unlock the wealth curve:Driving investment opportunities across wealth levels requires democratizing products and services. Firms should offer high-value options, from alternative investments to private banking, to a wider range of investors.\n",
      "Rethink future offerings:Investment firms must reimagine their offerings for the next era of investing. This includes using digital solutions to drive down costs and providing financial education and tools to make investing accessible to all.\n",
      "Redefine sustainable investing:Investment firms need innovative sustainable offerings that balance market returns with positive environmental impact and address potential misconceptions.\n",
      "Leverage outsourcing for efficiency:Outsourcing middle-office and operational functions provides leverage and streamlines core activities. This enables providers to serve more clients and operate at a lower cost, freeing up resources for strategic focus.\n",
      "Drive value from advisory services:Firms should consider fee-for-service options, fee reductions, and performance-based pricing to drive client value and attract and retain clients.\n",
      "Harness the power of data:Personalizing wealth management services at scale hinges on data. By analysing multiple data sources, firms can better understand investor preferences and behaviours and adjust their market position.\n",
      "Unleash wealth management with AI:AI has transformative potential in wealth management, enhancing client experiences and operational efficiency. Firms should adopt an AI-focused approach for business growth.\n",
      "Empower in-house solutions:Explore building in-house solutions using AI and low-code tools for cost savings, customization, and market differentiation. Low-code no-code tools and Generative AI facilitate this transition.\n",
      "What is evident to us through this study is that new entrants will serve as catalysts for change and have showcased what is possible. Ultimately, the industry is capital-intensive and those with an established investor base and large balance sheet are likely to come out on top.\n",
      "The true winners will be the end investors and their families, and that should be the primary metric by which we measure the future success.\n",

      "The climate and biodiversity crises are posing significant challenges to the insurance sector. In response, insurance companies have started implementing risk mitigation and resilience efforts. However, to effectively address the root causes of climate change and nature loss, more sustainable insurance solutions are needed.\n",
      "This global report, jointly written together with WWF, outlines the most important actions that insurance companies should take to fulfil their responsibilities and contribute to global climate and biodiversity goals through their underwriting business.\n",
      "This report entitled,Underwriting our planet: how insurers can help address the crises in climate and biodiversity, aims to shed light on the positive and negative links between insurance underwriting and climate change and biodiversity loss. It discusses the association of insurance activities with the five most important drivers of biodiversity loss. The report looks at how specific underwriting practices interact with such drivers and describes current strategies to mitigate the harmful and amplify the helpful using real-world examples of potential products and actions that insurers can undertake.\n",
      "Building on established literature and interviews with subject matter experts, the report covers a wide range of non-life insurance and reinsurance fields, such as liability insurance, marine and vehicle insurance, or property insurance with practical examples from various insurance companies around the world.\n",
      "The report is primarily aimed at insurance companies, but is also relevant for policy makers, insurance regulators and supervisors, as it provides recommendations on how the insurance sector can support global climate and biodiversity goals by aligning insurance regulation, policies and supervision as part of their transition planning towards a net zero, nature positive economy.\n",

      "It’s nearly impossible to go a day without hearing about the potential uses and implications of generative AI—and for good reason. Generative AI has the potential to not just repurpose or optimize existing data or processes, it can rapidly generate novel and creative outputs for just about any individual or business, regardless of technical know-how. It may come as no surprise that generative AI could have significant implications for the insurance industry.\n",
      "Today, many enterprise organizations are finding opportunities to use generative AI in “horizontal” use cases enabling everything from dialogue generation for virtual assistants, to automated code generation, marketing and sales content generation, and much more. This convergence across industries allows organizations to leverage capabilities built by others to improve speed to market and/or become fast followers.\n",
      "The insurance industry, on the other hand, presents unique sector-specific—and highly sustainable—value-creation opportunities, referred to as “vertical” use cases. These opportunities require deep domain knowledge, contextual understanding, expertise, and the potential need to fine-tune existing models or invest in building special purpose models. The real game changer for the insurance industry will likely be bringing disparate generative AI use cases together to build a holistic, seamless, end-to-end solution at scale.\n",
      "Insurance organizations have a remarkable opportunity to create substantial value and realize the potential of generative AI by making well-thought-out investments that focus on three key value dimensions:\n",
      "Several generative AI use cases are gaining traction across insurance subsectors as insurers strive to strike the right balance between harnessing value and managing risk:\n",
      "Though the opportunities and value created by generative AI are impressive, artificial intelligence also introduces potential risks into the insurance industry. Insurance industry leaders would be wise to consider the following when scaling:\n",
      "To minimize risk, insurance companies should prioritize the development of ethical artificial intelligence; leverage diverse and representative training data, evaluate, and audit their AI systems on a consistent basis through a robust governance model; and maintain transparency in decision-making. To learn next steps your insurance organization should take when considering generative AI,download the full report.\n",
      "Driving business results with generative AI requires a well-considered strategy and close collaboration between cross-disciplinary teams. In addition, with a technology that is advancing as quickly as generative AI, insurance organizations should look for support and insight from partners, colleagues, and third-party organizations with experience in the generative AI space.\n",

      "The pandemic has been an unprecedented and wide-ranging interruption of our normal lives, but it didn’t affect everyone equally. This was certainly true of COVID-19’s financial impact. While many lost their jobs or were furloughed, others benefited from a booming stock market.\n",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a sense of financial insecurity—even among the well-off. While the pandemic is a health crisis, the biggest motivator for saving more is “in case I have large, unexpected costs,” reinforcing the evidence that individuals now want to be prepared for unwelcome contingencies.\n",
      "To gain insights into the financial consequences the pandemic has had on individuals globally, Deloitte Global commissioned a survey of individuals in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States to answer a series of questions, including: How has the pandemic affected the savings of different demographic groups? Which groups have been impacted worst? How have attitudes to savings changed? How are people changing their financial behavior in response to these changes? In what ways did these phenomena vary across countries?\n",
      "This report reveals a pervasive sense of pandemic-related financial anxiety, regardless of how the pandemic affected participants. It yields useful insights into the ways that the pandemic has changed individuals’ financial attitudes and behaviors. It also contains lessons for all those who seek to help people manage their finances in uncertain times. Savers in the post-pandemic world are anxious about their financial future. They have seen that an unexpected crisis can upend the world, and their lives along with it. The financial services industry has a role to play in helping savers prepare in case a similar crisis should strike again.\n",
      "The financial products and services that savers want:\n",
      "Before the pandemic, individuals might have been expected to dedicate the bulk of their surplus cash to consumption. Now they have pivoted to saving and investment. This may signal a lasting shift in attitude and consequent behavior. The pandemic has upended so many aspects of our lives. How we feel about our personal finances is one of them. The report also points to the opportunities that await financial services providers as they navigate their way through a long-term change in savers’ attitudes and behaviors.\n",

      "The adoption of emerging technologies across the global financial services ecosystem continues to drive considerable benefits for institutions and consumers. However, it also introduces new risks, some of which may threaten the stability of the financial system if not properly identified and managed.\n",
      "To better understand these risks and identify approaches to address and mitigate them, the World Economic Forum and Deloitte launched the Technology, Innovation and Systemic Risk initiative. In 2022, the initiative published its first report,Beneath the Surface: Technology-driven systemic risk and the continued need for innovation.This report raised new questions about the sectoral and regional conditions under which risk can originate and spread across the ecosystem, and the targeted mitigation solutions that warrant further exploration.\n",
      "In this new study,Pushing through undercurrents, we explore the implications of technology-driven risk originating in five sectors (banking, capital markets, payments, insurance and investment management), and investigate the regional implications of critical cross-sector risks.\n",
      "The outcomes of the research have reinforced the urgency for financial services executives at the intersection of strategy, innovation, and risk management to better access the sectoral and regional forces contributing to their unique exposure to technology-driven risk, and the targeted mitigation opportunities available to them. Insights from this report also help policy-makers and regulators better understand how to focus mitigation strategies that support private entities for specific sectors and regions.\n",

       "   'Deloitte sponsored the Economist Impact to survey 360 insurance executives who are engaged in the implementation of IFRS 17. This research has produced new insights on the collective view of the insurance industry on IFRS 17.',\n",
       "   'Additionally, we have published a statistical compendium that shares all of the data from the Economist Impact survey to enable you to go deeper into specific areas of interest.',\n",
       "   'In this first report of the survey findings, the Economist Impact team has focused on the responses we collected from participants based in the European Union (EU) given the EU-endorsed version of IFRS 17 has a key difference compared with the text originally published by the International Accounting Standards Board. This difference is the addition of a voluntary exemption from one key requirement in IFRS 17 that many stakeholders in the EU endorsement process believed should not apply on a mandatory basis to a particular type of life insurance business commonly found in the EU.',\n",
       "   'The highlights from the survey are that a large majority of EU-headquartered insurance groups will choose the voluntary adoption of the EU exemption. The overwhelming sentiment indicated that this choice is not expected to significantly dilute the benefit of the level playing field that IFRS 17 could deliver globally. Participants in the survey also noted their plan to provide disclosure on the use of the EU exemption.',\n",
       "   'Download the report',\n",
       "   'In this second article of a four-part series, the Economist Impact team focuses on the technology considerations of the survey. The effort expended on the technology needed for IFRS 17 compliance was often more than initially estimated, but the expected benefits also appear to be greater. As the survey revealed, a much more transparent and agile finance capability may now be possible because packaged software helps to capture new information and offers new analyses that were previously impossible.',\n",
       "   'IFRS 17 programs were often reported to be more complex, to take longer than expected, to cost more than planned and to require more broadly skilled resources. And these results did not vary much for different business scenarios. Data capture and analysis was a recurring theme as insurers found that the requirement for additional data granularity and governance was a primary consideration as they integrated and tested packaged solutions. The need to build foundational capabilities to tackle these challenges has created new opportunities to better report and manage financial and operational information.',\n",

       "   'In this third article of our four-part series, we report on the views from the participants in the 2022 Global IFRS 17 Insurance Survey on how they will use the new IFRS 17 financial language to communicate to investors. With the focus on building sub-ledgers, introducing new charts of accounts, preparing data, and updating actuarial models, it is also sometimes easy with IFRS 17 to lose sight of the numbers themselves, and the story they tell about the performance of the underlying business.',\n",
       "   'Yet, IFRS 17 is fundamentally different and therefore difficult to compare against IFRS 4, the previous standard for insurance accounting, which was designed as a mere interim solution. “The numbers” are much more than just a new balance sheet and P&L with additional, detailed disclosures. The survey shows that two aspects really stand out in terms of understanding the new world of IFRS 17:',\n",

In this final article of a four-part series, we report on the views from the participants of the 2022 Global IFRS 17 Insurance Survey on whether they agree that the benefits of adopting IFRS 17 will outweigh the expected costs. With the bulk of the implementation investments made, and with insurance accounting set to be transformed, what long-term benefits can insurers expect beyond compliance and how can these benefits be grasped?',\n",
       "   'Nearly half of all survey participants say that improved technology has brought new capabilities – with the possibility of new opportunities and benefits emerging as a result of the changes made.

       "   'The adoption of emerging technologies across the global financial services ecosystem continues to drive considerable benefits for institutions and consumers. However, it also introduces new risks, some of which may threaten the stability of the financial system if not properly identified and managed.',\n",
       "   'To better understand these risks and identify approaches to address and mitigate them, the World Economic Forum and Deloitte launched the Technology, Innovation and Systemic Risk initiative. In 2022, the initiative published its first report,Beneath the Surface: Technology-driven systemic risk and the continued need for innovation.This report raised new questions about the sectoral and regional conditions under which risk can originate and spread across the ecosystem, and the targeted mitigation solutions that warrant further exploration.',\n",
       "   'In this new study,Pushing through undercurrents, we explore the implications of technology-driven risk originating in five sectors (banking, capital markets, payments, insurance and investment management), and investigate the regional implications of critical cross-sector risks.',\n",
       "   'The outcomes of the research have reinforced the urgency for financial services executives at the intersection of strategy, innovation, and risk management to better access the sectoral and regional forces contributing to their unique exposure to technology-driven risk, and the targeted mitigation opportunities available to them. Insights from this report also help policy-makers and regulators better understand how to focus mitigation strategies that support private entities for specific sectors and regions.',\n",

       "   'Deloitte sponsored the Economist Impact to survey 360 insurance executives who are engaged in the implementation of IFRS 17. This research has produced new insights on the collective view of the insurance industry on IFRS 17.',\n",
       "   'Additionally, we have published a statistical compendium that shares all of the data from the Economist Impact survey to enable you to go deeper into specific areas of interest.',\n",
       "   'In this first report of the survey findings, the Economist Impact team has focused on the responses we collected from participants based in the European Union (EU) given the EU-endorsed version of IFRS 17 has a key difference compared with the text originally published by the International Accounting Standards Board. This difference is the addition of a voluntary exemption from one key requirement in IFRS 17 that many stakeholders in the EU endorsement process believed should not apply on a mandatory basis to a particular type of life insurance business commonly found in the EU.',\n",
       "   'The highlights from the survey are that a large majority of EU-headquartered insurance groups will choose the voluntary adoption of the EU exemption. The overwhelming sentiment indicated that this choice is not expected to significantly dilute the benefit of the level playing field that IFRS 17 could deliver globally. Participants in the survey also noted their plan to provide disclosure on the use of the EU exemption.',\n",
       "   'Download the report',\n",
       "   'In this second article of a four-part series, the Economist Impact team focuses on the technology considerations of the survey. The effort expended on the technology needed for IFRS 17 compliance was often more than initially estimated, but the expected benefits also appear to be greater. As the survey revealed, a much more transparent and agile finance capability may now be possible because packaged software helps to capture new information and offers new analyses that were previously impossible.',\n",
       "   'IFRS 17 programs were often reported to be more complex, to take longer than expected, to cost more than planned and to require more broadly skilled resources. And these results did not vary much for different business scenarios. Data capture and analysis was a recurring theme as insurers found that the requirement for additional data granularity and governance was a primary consideration as they integrated and tested packaged solutions. The need to build foundational capabilities to tackle these challenges has created new opportunities to better report and manage financial and operational information.',\n",
       "   'Download the report',\n",
       "   'In this third article of our four-part series, we report on the views from the participants in the 2022 Global IFRS 17 Insurance Survey on how they will use the new IFRS 17 financial language to communicate to investors. With the focus on building sub-ledgers, introducing new charts of accounts, preparing data, and updating actuarial models, it is also sometimes easy with IFRS 17 to lose sight of the numbers themselves, and the story they tell about the performance of the underlying business.',\n",
       "   'Yet, IFRS 17 is fundamentally different and therefore difficult to compare against IFRS 4, the previous standard for insurance accounting, which was designed as a mere interim solution. “The numbers” are much more than just a new balance sheet and P&L with additional, detailed disclosures. The survey shows that two aspects really stand out in terms of understanding the new world of IFRS 17:',\n",

In this final article of a four-part series, we report on the views from the participants of the 2022 Global IFRS 17 Insurance Survey on whether they agree that the benefits of adopting IFRS 17 will outweigh the expected costs. With the bulk of the implementation investments made, and with insurance accounting set to be transformed, what long-term benefits can insurers expect beyond compliance and how can these benefits be grasped?',\n",
       "   'Nearly half of all survey participants say that improved technology has brought new capabilities – with the possibility of new opportunities and benefits emerging as a result of the changes made.

It may come as no surprise that generative AI could have significant implications for the insurance industry.',\n",

      "Small business insurance has been one of the most talked about areas of insurance over the past five years. While talk has been high, action has been low from most incumbent insurers. Small businesses are changing their business models (e.g., ghost kitchens, digitally enabled operations, etc.) to align with evolving consumer behaviors and heightened risk awareness caused by the pandemic. This report from Deloitte Global was developed from a global survey which found that the need has never been greater for insurers to invest and differentiate in the market for small-to-medium enterprise (SME) insurance.\n",
      "To help answer how insurers can explore the small business insurance market, Deloitte surveyed 5,300 SMEs from 14 countries to understand their views about insurance.\n",
      "The survey revealed six key findings:\n",

      "We surveyed global insurance companies to look at readiness, perceptions, technology and the impact IFRS 17 may have beyond 2023.\n",
      "Deloitte sponsored the Economist Impact to survey 360 insurance executives who are engaged in the implementation of IFRS 17. This research has produced new insights on the collective view of the insurance industry on IFRS 17.\n",
      "Additionally, we have published a statistical compendium that shares all of the data from the Economist Impact survey to enable you to go deeper into specific areas of interest.\n",
      "In this first report of the survey findings, the Economist Impact team has focused on the responses we collected from participants based in the European Union (EU) given the EU-endorsed version of IFRS 17 has a key difference compared with the text originally published by the International Accounting Standards Board. This difference is the addition of a voluntary exemption from one key requirement in IFRS 17 that many stakeholders in the EU endorsement process believed should not apply on a mandatory basis to a particular type of life insurance business commonly found in the EU.\n",
      "The highlights from the survey are that a large majority of EU-headquartered insurance groups will choose the voluntary adoption of the EU exemption. The overwhelming sentiment indicated that this choice is not expected to significantly dilute the benefit of the level playing field that IFRS 17 could deliver globally. Participants in the survey also noted their plan to provide disclosure on the use of the EU exemption.\n",
      "Download the report\n",
      "In this second article of a four-part series, the Economist Impact team focuses on the technology considerations of the survey. The effort expended on the technology needed for IFRS 17 compliance was often more than initially estimated, but the expected benefits also appear to be greater. As the survey revealed, a much more transparent and agile finance capability may now be possible because packaged software helps to capture new information and offers new analyses that were previously impossible.\n",
      "IFRS 17 programs were often reported to be more complex, to take longer than expected, to cost more than planned and to require more broadly skilled resources. And these results did not vary much for different business scenarios. Data capture and analysis was a recurring theme as insurers found that the requirement for additional data granularity and governance was a primary consideration as they integrated and tested packaged solutions. The need to build foundational capabilities to tackle these challenges has created new opportunities to better report and manage financial and operational information.\n",
      "Download the report\n",
      "In this third article of our four-part series, we report on the views from the participants in the 2022 Global IFRS 17 Insurance Survey on how they will use the new IFRS 17 financial language to communicate to investors. With the focus on building sub-ledgers, introducing new charts of accounts, preparing data, and updating actuarial models, it is also sometimes easy with IFRS 17 to lose sight of the numbers themselves, and the story they tell about the performance of the underlying business.\n",
      "Yet, IFRS 17 is fundamentally different and therefore difficult to compare against IFRS 4, the previous standard for insurance accounting, which was designed as a mere interim solution. “The numbers” are much more than just a new balance sheet and P&L with additional, detailed disclosures. The survey shows that two aspects really stand out in terms of understanding the new world of IFRS 17:\n",

      "What might the future look like as the implementation of the standard continues? In this final article of a four-part series, we report on the views from the participants of the 2022 Global IFRS 17 Insurance Survey on whether they agree that the benefits of adopting IFRS 17 will outweigh the expected costs. With the bulk of the implementation investments made, and with insurance accounting set to be transformed, what long-term benefits can insurers expect beyond compliance and how can these benefits be grasped?\n",
      "Nearly half of all survey participants say that improved technology has brought new capabilities – with the possibility of new opportunities and benefits emerging as a result of the changes made. The survey shows that many insurers have already entered the IFRS17 world, and are moving to reap these potential benefits:\n",

      "The digital transformation of financial services organizations is extending into ecosystems, introducing new players and shifting traditional roles. The Institute of International Finance (IIF) and Deloitte have been working together, speaking with public and private institutions, to better understand how these new ecosystems are impacting the industry. These ecosystems are evolving into dynamic networks who create value through complex models of collaboration, competition, and innovation. We will look at this across several dimensions in a series of reports.\n",
      "In this report from the IIF and Deloitte we look at the impact of data policies and the importance of broadening the scope from Open Banking to Open Data, not just Open Finance.

      "Global megatrends are reshaping the landscape of the global wealth management industry and redefining investor needs. To stay ahead of this industry shift, investment management firms need to revisit their strategies with a greater emphasis on investor expectations and competitor analysis.\n",
      "To analyze how investment firms are planning to meet fast-changing investor expectations, Deloitte, in collaboration with ThoughtLab and other industry specialists, conducted a global survey of investors and investment providers and researched how the industry is evolving.  We look at the impact of megatrends including technology, regulatory & taxes, competition, demographics and economic.\n",
      "The findings highlighted the following:\n",
      "Win with modernization:The changing face of investors demands personalized solutions and a more inclusive advisor base. Investment firms must harness technology and data to understand these needs, find market niches, and tailor their offerings accordingly.\n",
      "Capitalize on client diversity:As investors become more diverse in age, location, gender, wealth level, and lifestyle, firms that leverage technology and data will have a competitive edge. This includes building a diverse advisor base to cater to the varied needs of clients.\n",
      "Redefine digital for investors:Embrace the next generation of digital services, leveraging digitally enabled functionality for tasks like account opening, transfers, and communication with advisors.\n",
      "Innovate to drive performance:Seamlessly blend high tech with high touch by using technology to enhance advisors' capabilities, automate mundane tasks, and deliver a superior client experience, firms can position themselves as digital leaders.\n",
      "Empower the future advisor:Technology is revolutionizing the role of financial advisors, enabling them to manage a larger client base and offer personalized, comprehensive advice by automating routine tasks.\n",
      "Unlock the wealth curve:Driving investment opportunities across wealth levels requires democratizing products and services. Firms should offer high-value options, from alternative investments to private banking, to a wider range of investors.\n",
      "Rethink future offerings:Investment firms must reimagine their offerings for the next era of investing. This includes using digital solutions to drive down costs and providing financial education and tools to make investing accessible to all.\n",
      "Redefine sustainable investing:Investment firms need innovative sustainable offerings that balance market returns with positive environmental impact and address potential misconceptions.\n",
      "Leverage outsourcing for efficiency:Outsourcing middle-office and operational functions provides leverage and streamlines core activities. This enables providers to serve more clients and operate at a lower cost, freeing up resources for strategic focus.\n",
      "Drive value from advisory services:Firms should consider fee-for-service options, fee reductions, and performance-based pricing to drive client value and attract and retain clients.\n",
      "Harness the power of data:Personalizing wealth management services at scale hinges on data. By analysing multiple data sources, firms can better understand investor preferences and behaviours and adjust their market position.\n",
      "Unleash wealth management with AI:AI has transformative potential in wealth management, enhancing client experiences and operational efficiency. Firms should adopt an AI-focused approach for business growth.\n",
      "Empower in-house solutions:Explore building in-house solutions using AI and low-code tools for cost savings, customization, and market differentiation. Low-code no-code tools and Generative AI facilitate this transition.\n",
      "What is evident to us through this study is that new entrants will serve as catalysts for change and have showcased what is possible. Ultimately, the industry is capital-intensive and those with an established investor base and large balance sheet are likely to come out on top.\n",
      "The true winners will be the end investors and their families, and that should be the primary metric by which we measure the future success.\n",

      "The climate and biodiversity crises are posing significant challenges to the insurance sector. In response, insurance companies have started implementing risk mitigation and resilience efforts. However, to effectively address the root causes of climate change and nature loss, more sustainable insurance solutions are needed.\n",
      "This global report, jointly written together with WWF, outlines the most important actions that insurance companies should take to fulfil their responsibilities and contribute to global climate and biodiversity goals through their underwriting business.\n",
      "This report entitled,Underwriting our planet: how insurers can help address the crises in climate and biodiversity, aims to shed light on the positive and negative links between insurance underwriting and climate change and biodiversity loss. It discusses the association of insurance activities with the five most important drivers of biodiversity loss. The report looks at how specific underwriting practices interact with such drivers and describes current strategies to mitigate the harmful and amplify the helpful using real-world examples of potential products and actions that insurers can undertake.\n",
      "Building on established literature and interviews with subject matter experts, the report covers a wide range of non-life insurance and reinsurance fields, such as liability insurance, marine and vehicle insurance, or property insurance with practical examples from various insurance companies around the world.\n",

      "It’s nearly impossible to go a day without hearing about the potential uses and implications of generative AI—and for good reason. Generative AI has the potential to not just repurpose or optimize existing data or processes, it can rapidly generate novel and creative outputs for just about any individual or business, regardless of technical know-how. It may come as no surprise that generative AI could have significant implications for the insurance industry.\n",
      "Today, many enterprise organizations are finding opportunities to use generative AI in “horizontal” use cases enabling everything from dialogue generation for virtual assistants, to automated code generation, marketing and sales content generation, and much more. This convergence across industries allows organizations to leverage capabilities built by others to improve speed to market and/or become fast followers.\n",
      "The insurance industry, on the other hand, presents unique sector-specific—and highly sustainable—value-creation opportunities, referred to as “vertical” use cases. These opportunities require deep domain knowledge, contextual understanding, expertise, and the potential need to fine-tune existing models or invest in building special purpose models. The real game changer for the insurance industry will likely be bringing disparate generative AI use cases together to build a holistic, seamless, end-to-end solution at scale.\n",
      "Insurance organizations have a remarkable opportunity to create substantial value and realize the potential of generative AI by making well-thought-out investments that focus on three key value dimensions:\n",
      "Several generative AI use cases are gaining traction across insurance subsectors as insurers strive to strike the right balance between harnessing value and managing risk:\n",
      "Though the opportunities and value created by generative AI are impressive, artificial intelligence also introduces potential risks into the insurance industry. Insurance industry leaders would be wise to consider the following when scaling:\n",
      "To minimize risk, insurance companies should prioritize the development of ethical artificial intelligence; leverage diverse and representative training data, evaluate, and audit their AI systems on a consistent basis through a robust governance model; and maintain transparency in decision-making. To learn next steps your insurance organization should take when considering generative AI,download the full report.\n",
      "Driving business results with generative AI requires a well-considered strategy and close collaboration between cross-disciplinary teams. In addition, with a technology that is advancing as quickly as generative AI, insurance organizations should look for support and insight from partners, colleagues, and third-party organizations with experience in the generative AI space.\n",

      "To gain insights into the financial consequences the pandemic has had on individuals globally, Deloitte Global commissioned a survey of individuals in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States to answer a series of questions, including: How has the pandemic affected the savings of different demographic groups? Which groups have been impacted worst? How have attitudes to savings changed? How are people changing their financial behavior in response to these changes? In what ways did these phenomena vary across countries?\n",
      "This report reveals a pervasive sense of pandemic-related financial anxiety, regardless of how the pandemic affected participants. It yields useful insights into the ways that the pandemic has changed individuals’ financial attitudes and behaviors. It also contains lessons for all those who seek to help people manage their finances in uncertain times. Savers in the post-pandemic world are anxious about their financial future. They have seen that an unexpected crisis can upend the world, and their lives along with it. The financial services industry has a role to play in helping savers prepare in case a similar crisis should strike again.\n",
      "The financial products and services that savers want:\n",
      "Before the pandemic, individuals might have been expected to dedicate the bulk of their surplus cash to consumption. Now they have pivoted to saving and investment. This may signal a lasting shift in attitude and consequent behavior. The pandemic has upended so many aspects of our lives. How we feel about our personal finances is one of them. The report also points to the opportunities that await financial services providers as they navigate their way through a long-term change in savers’ attitudes and behaviors.\n",

      "A report from World Economic Forum and Deloitte\n",
      "The adoption of emerging technologies across the global financial services ecosystem continues to drive considerable benefits for institutions and consumers. However, it also introduces new risks, some of which may threaten the stability of the financial system if not properly identified and managed.\n",
      "To better understand these risks and identify approaches to address and mitigate them, the World Economic Forum and Deloitte launched the Technology, Innovation and Systemic Risk initiative. In 2022, the initiative published its first report,Beneath the Surface: Technology-driven systemic risk and the continued need for innovation.This report raised new questions about the sectoral and regional conditions under which risk can originate and spread across the ecosystem, and the targeted mitigation solutions that warrant further exploration.\n",
      "In this new study,Pushing through undercurrents, we explore the implications of technology-driven risk originating in five sectors (banking, capital markets, payments, insurance and investment management), and investigate the regional implications of critical cross-sector risks.\n",
      "The outcomes of the research have reinforced the urgency for financial services executives at the intersection of strategy, innovation, and risk management to better access the sectoral and regional forces contributing to their unique exposure to technology-driven risk, and the targeted mitigation opportunities available to them. Insights from this report also help policy-makers and regulators better understand how to focus mitigation strategies that support private entities for specific sectors and regions.\n",

      "Small business insurance has been one of the most talked about areas of insurance over the past five years. While talk has been high, action has been low from most incumbent insurers. Small businesses are changing their business models (e.g., ghost kitchens, digitally enabled operations, etc.) to align with evolving consumer behaviors and heightened risk awareness caused by the pandemic. This report from Deloitte Global was developed from a global survey which found that the need has never been greater for insurers to invest and differentiate in the market for small-to-medium enterprise (SME) insurance.\n",
      "To help answer how insurers can explore the small business insurance market, Deloitte surveyed 5,300 SMEs from 14 countries to understand their views about insurance.\n",
      "The survey revealed six key findings:\n",
      "As the SME segment has so far been largely untapped in a meaningful way, we believe a significant opportunity exists for profitable growth through a targeted investment and sharpened focus on the segment.\n",

      "We surveyed global insurance companies to look at readiness, perceptions, technology and the impact IFRS 17 may have beyond 2023.\n",
      "Deloitte sponsored the Economist Impact to survey 360 insurance executives who are engaged in the implementation of IFRS 17. This research has produced new insights on the collective view of the insurance industry on IFRS 17.\n",
      "Additionally, we have published a statistical compendium that shares all of the data from the Economist Impact survey to enable you to go deeper into specific areas of interest.\n",
      "In this first report of the survey findings, the Economist Impact team has focused on the responses we collected from participants based in the European Union (EU) given the EU-endorsed version of IFRS 17 has a key difference compared with the text originally published by the International Accounting Standards Board. This difference is the addition of a voluntary exemption from one key requirement in IFRS 17 that many stakeholders in the EU endorsement process believed should not apply on a mandatory basis to a particular type of life insurance business commonly found in the EU.\n",
      "The highlights from the survey are that a large majority of EU-headquartered insurance groups will choose the voluntary adoption of the EU exemption. The overwhelming sentiment indicated that this choice is not expected to significantly dilute the benefit of the level playing field that IFRS 17 could deliver globally. Participants in the survey also noted their plan to provide disclosure on the use of the EU exemption.\n",
      "Download the report\n",
      "In this second article of a four-part series, the Economist Impact team focuses on the technology considerations of the survey. The effort expended on the technology needed for IFRS 17 compliance was often more than initially estimated, but the expected benefits also appear to be greater. As the survey revealed, a much more transparent and agile finance capability may now be possible because packaged software helps to capture new information and offers new analyses that were previously impossible.\n",
      "IFRS 17 programs were often reported to be more complex, to take longer than expected, to cost more than planned and to require more broadly skilled resources. And these results did not vary much for different business scenarios. Data capture and analysis was a recurring theme as insurers found that the requirement for additional data granularity and governance was a primary consideration as they integrated and tested packaged solutions. The need to build foundational capabilities to tackle these challenges has created new opportunities to better report and manage financial and operational information.\n",
      "Download the report\n",
      "In this third article of our four-part series, we report on the views from the participants in the 2022 Global IFRS 17 Insurance Survey on how they will use the new IFRS 17 financial language to communicate to investors. With the focus on building sub-ledgers, introducing new charts of accounts, preparing data, and updating actuarial models, it is also sometimes easy with IFRS 17 to lose sight of the numbers themselves, and the story they tell about the performance of the underlying business.\n",
      "Yet, IFRS 17 is fundamentally different and therefore difficult to compare against IFRS 4, the previous standard for insurance accounting, which was designed as a mere interim solution. “The numbers” are much more than just a new balance sheet and P&L with additional, detailed disclosures. The survey shows that two aspects really stand out in terms of understanding the new world of IFRS 17:\n",
      "Download the report\n",
      "What might the future look like as the implementation of the standard continues? In this final article of a four-part series, we report on the views from the participants of the 2022 Global IFRS 17 Insurance Survey on whether they agree that the benefits of adopting IFRS 17 will outweigh the expected costs. With the bulk of the implementation investments made, and with insurance accounting set to be transformed, what long-term benefits can insurers expect beyond compliance and how can these benefits be grasped?\n",
      "Nearly half of all survey participants say that improved technology has brought new capabilities – with the possibility of new opportunities and benefits emerging as a result of the changes made. The survey shows that many insurers have already entered the IFRS17 world, and are moving to reap these potential benefits:\n",

      "Under the sponsorship of Deloitte, the Economist Impact surveyed 360 insurance executives during May and June 2022 to gauge the final views of the global insurance industry on IFRS 17. This survey took place only a few months before the \"go-live\" date of IFRS 17 on 1 January 2023.\n",

      "The digital transformation of financial services organizations is extending into ecosystems, introducing new players and shifting traditional roles. The Institute of International Finance (IIF) and Deloitte have been working together, speaking with public and private institutions, to better understand how these new ecosystems are impacting the industry. These ecosystems are evolving into dynamic networks who create value through complex models of collaboration, competition, and innovation. We will look at this across several dimensions in a series of reports.\n",
      "In this report from the IIF and Deloitte we look at the impact of data policies and the importance of broadening the scope from Open Banking to Open Data, not just Open Finance.

      "Global megatrends are reshaping the landscape of the global wealth management industry and redefining investor needs. To stay ahead of this industry shift, investment management firms need to revisit their strategies with a greater emphasis on investor expectations and competitor analysis.\n",
      "To analyze how investment firms are planning to meet fast-changing investor expectations, Deloitte, in collaboration with ThoughtLab and other industry specialists, conducted a global survey of investors and investment providers and researched how the industry is evolving.  We look at the impact of megatrends including technology, regulatory & taxes, competition, demographics and economic.\n",
      "The findings highlighted the following:\n",
      "Win with modernization:The changing face of investors demands personalized solutions and a more inclusive advisor base. Investment firms must harness technology and data to understand these needs, find market niches, and tailor their offerings accordingly.\n",
      "Capitalize on client diversity:As investors become more diverse in age, location, gender, wealth level, and lifestyle, firms that leverage technology and data will have a competitive edge. This includes building a diverse advisor base to cater to the varied needs of clients.\n",
      "Redefine digital for investors:Embrace the next generation of digital services, leveraging digitally enabled functionality for tasks like account opening, transfers, and communication with advisors.\n",
      "Innovate to drive performance:Seamlessly blend high tech with high touch by using technology to enhance advisors' capabilities, automate mundane tasks, and deliver a superior client experience, firms can position themselves as digital leaders.\n",
      "Empower the future advisor:Technology is revolutionizing the role of financial advisors, enabling them to manage a larger client base and offer personalized, comprehensive advice by automating routine tasks.\n",
      "Unlock the wealth curve:Driving investment opportunities across wealth levels requires democratizing products and services. Firms should offer high-value options, from alternative investments to private banking, to a wider range of investors.\n",
      "Rethink future offerings:Investment firms must reimagine their offerings for the next era of investing. This includes using digital solutions to drive down costs and providing financial education and tools to make investing accessible to all.\n",
      "Redefine sustainable investing:Investment firms need innovative sustainable offerings that balance market returns with positive environmental impact and address potential misconceptions.\n",
      "Leverage outsourcing for efficiency:Outsourcing middle-office and operational functions provides leverage and streamlines core activities. This enables providers to serve more clients and operate at a lower cost, freeing up resources for strategic focus.\n",
      "Drive value from advisory services:Firms should consider fee-for-service options, fee reductions, and performance-based pricing to drive client value and attract and retain clients.\n",
      "Harness the power of data:Personalizing wealth management services at scale hinges on data. By analysing multiple data sources, firms can better understand investor preferences and behaviours and adjust their market position.\n",
      "Unleash wealth management with AI:AI has transformative potential in wealth management, enhancing client experiences and operational efficiency. Firms should adopt an AI-focused approach for business growth.\n",
      "Empower in-house solutions:Explore building in-house solutions using AI and low-code tools for cost savings, customization, and market differentiation. Low-code no-code tools and Generative AI facilitate this transition.\n",
      "What is evident to us through this study is that new entrants will serve as catalysts for change and have showcased what is possible. Ultimately, the industry is capital-intensive and those with an established investor base and large balance sheet are likely to come out on top.\n",
      "The true winners will be the end investors and their families, and that should be the primary metric by which we measure the future success.\n",

      "The climate and biodiversity crises are posing significant challenges to the insurance sector. In response, insurance companies have started implementing risk mitigation and resilience efforts. However, to effectively address the root causes of climate change and nature loss, more sustainable insurance solutions are needed.\n",
      "This global report, jointly written together with WWF, outlines the most important actions that insurance companies should take to fulfil their responsibilities and contribute to global climate and biodiversity goals through their underwriting business.\n",
      "This report entitled,Underwriting our planet: how insurers can help address the crises in climate and biodiversity, aims to shed light on the positive and negative links between insurance underwriting and climate change and biodiversity loss. It discusses the association of insurance activities with the five most important drivers of biodiversity loss. The report looks at how specific underwriting practices interact with such drivers and describes current strategies to mitigate the harmful and amplify the helpful using real-world examples of potential products and actions that insurers can undertake.\n",
      "Building on established literature and interviews with subject matter experts, the report covers a wide range of non-life insurance and reinsurance fields, such as liability insurance, marine and vehicle insurance, or property insurance with practical examples from various insurance companies around the world.\n",
      "The report is primarily aimed at insurance companies, but is also relevant for policy makers, insurance regulators and supervisors, as it provides recommendations on how the insurance sector can support global climate and biodiversity goals by aligning insurance regulation, policies and supervision as part of their transition planning towards a net zero, nature positive economy.\n",

      "It’s nearly impossible to go a day without hearing about the potential uses and implications of generative AI—and for good reason. Generative AI has the potential to not just repurpose or optimize existing data or processes, it can rapidly generate novel and creative outputs for just about any individual or business, regardless of technical know-how. It may come as no surprise that generative AI could have significant implications for the insurance industry.\n",
      "Today, many enterprise organizations are finding opportunities to use generative AI in “horizontal” use cases enabling everything from dialogue generation for virtual assistants, to automated code generation, marketing and sales content generation, and much more. This convergence across industries allows organizations to leverage capabilities built by others to improve speed to market and/or become fast followers.\n",
      "The insurance industry, on the other hand, presents unique sector-specific—and highly sustainable—value-creation opportunities, referred to as “vertical” use cases. These opportunities require deep domain knowledge, contextual understanding, expertise, and the potential need to fine-tune existing models or invest in building special purpose models. The real game changer for the insurance industry will likely be bringing disparate generative AI use cases together to build a holistic, seamless, end-to-end solution at scale.\n",
      "Insurance organizations have a remarkable opportunity to create substantial value and realize the potential of generative AI by making well-thought-out investments that focus on three key value dimensions:\n",
      "Several generative AI use cases are gaining traction across insurance subsectors as insurers strive to strike the right balance between harnessing value and managing risk:\n",
      "Though the opportunities and value created by generative AI are impressive, artificial intelligence also introduces potential risks into the insurance industry. Insurance industry leaders would be wise to consider the following when scaling:\n",
      "To minimize risk, insurance companies should prioritize the development of ethical artificial intelligence; leverage diverse and representative training data, evaluate, and audit their AI systems on a consistent basis through a robust governance model; and maintain transparency in decision-making. To learn next steps your insurance organization should take when considering generative AI,download the full report.\n",
      "Driving business results with generative AI requires a well-considered strategy and close collaboration between cross-disciplinary teams. In addition, with a technology that is advancing as quickly as generative AI, insurance organizations should look for support and insight from partners, colleagues, and third-party organizations with experience in the generative AI space.\n",

      "The pandemic has been an unprecedented and wide-ranging interruption of our normal lives, but it didn’t affect everyone equally. This was certainly true of COVID-19’s financial impact. While many lost their jobs or were furloughed, others benefited from a booming stock market.\n",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a sense of financial insecurity—even among the well-off. While the pandemic is a health crisis, the biggest motivator for saving more is “in case I have large, unexpected costs,” reinforcing the evidence that individuals now want to be prepared for unwelcome contingencies.\n",
      "To gain insights into the financial consequences the pandemic has had on individuals globally, Deloitte Global commissioned a survey of individuals in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States to answer a series of questions, including: How has the pandemic affected the savings of different demographic groups? Which groups have been impacted worst? How have attitudes to savings changed? How are people changing their financial behavior in response to these changes? In what ways did these phenomena vary across countries?\n",
      "This report reveals a pervasive sense of pandemic-related financial anxiety, regardless of how the pandemic affected participants. It yields useful insights into the ways that the pandemic has changed individuals’ financial attitudes and behaviors. It also contains lessons for all those who seek to help people manage their finances in uncertain times. Savers in the post-pandemic world are anxious about their financial future. They have seen that an unexpected crisis can upend the world, and their lives along with it. The financial services industry has a role to play in helping savers prepare in case a similar crisis should strike again.\n",
      "The financial products and services that savers want:\n",
      "Before the pandemic, individuals might have been expected to dedicate the bulk of their surplus cash to consumption. Now they have pivoted to saving and investment. This may signal a lasting shift in attitude and consequent behavior. The pandemic has upended so many aspects of our lives. How we feel about our personal finances is one of them. The report also points to the opportunities that await financial services providers as they navigate their way through a long-term change in savers’ attitudes and behaviors.\n",

      "The adoption of emerging technologies across the global financial services ecosystem continues to drive considerable benefits for institutions and consumers. However, it also introduces new risks, some of which may threaten the stability of the financial system if not properly identified and managed.\n",
      "To better understand these risks and identify approaches to address and mitigate them, the World Economic Forum and Deloitte launched the Technology, Innovation and Systemic Risk initiative. In 2022, the initiative published its first report,Beneath the Surface: Technology-driven systemic risk and the continued need for innovation.This report raised new questions about the sectoral and regional conditions under which risk can originate and spread across the ecosystem, and the targeted mitigation solutions that warrant further exploration.\n",
      "In this new study,Pushing through undercurrents, we explore the implications of technology-driven risk originating in five sectors (banking, capital markets, payments, insurance and investment management), and investigate the regional implications of critical cross-sector risks.\n",
      "The outcomes of the research have reinforced the urgency for financial services executives at the intersection of strategy, innovation, and risk management to better access the sectoral and regional forces contributing to their unique exposure to technology-driven risk, and the targeted mitigation opportunities available to them. Insights from this report also help policy-makers and regulators better understand how to focus mitigation strategies that support private entities for specific sectors and regions.\n",

      "Health equity is more than equitable access to care. We define health equity as the ability to fulfil our potential in all aspects of health and well-being.\n",
      "Although we have made incredible progress increasing average life expectancy significantly with modern medicine, the benefits have not been distributed equally. Significant inequities persist both across and within countries. These long-standing inequities have formed through structural flaws in the health care system.\n",
      "The mission of the Deloitte Health Equity Institutes (DHEIs) is to advance health equity to make an impact that matters.\n",
      "We aspire to be catalysts for change by bringing business, government, and community leaders together to intentionally design and build systems that advance health equity as an outcome. Together, we can create exponential impact for a more equitable society.\n",
